"That's what my wife calls it. Nice game, highly addictive. To bad the current client doesn't turn the screen in the heading you're travelling or even switch from portrait to landscape.  Adding the view in the direction your travelling would be a big improvement, next to zooming out depending on your speed.  Game is great, app has some serious flaws which I wouldn't expect as it's placed up-on maps. (which doesn't have these flaws)  It would be great if the app stops consuming resources when you exit the game. It or google maps is a real battery hog. (Both stay active when you exit the app)  BTW be aware, the compass seems to be broken in phones that don't have a gyro or compass.  Dynamic compass works on Moro G 2014, doesn't work on Moto G4 (latest) and Huawei G700.

"This game is great. It gets you moving, gets you social, it helps you appreciate the beauty in your city, the glyphs help your memory, xmp attacks help with reaction time.  My only complaint it that the faction we choose at the beginning is the one we have to stick with, unless we do a faction change which can take 6+ weeks.  There should be a 2 week grace period in case your faction's community is terrible like a certain city that has lots of sin...

The game can be fun and addictive it definitely get you out of the house. But there's still so many bugs with the game even three years later. The current issue I keep dealing with with some these most recent update is a lack of it actuallcommunicating back.

"The game is slated for the Resistance to win. Don't waste you time or money or gas if you're going to play as Enlightened; you're doomed to lose. The game describes the Enlightened as enslavers and the resistance as liberators, yeah that doesn't create a bias. Naturally, we are out numbered 10 to 1. The Resistance is notified immediately when their portals are under attack. Enlightened get a 5 minute delay. Superfun. This game is played from your car.
