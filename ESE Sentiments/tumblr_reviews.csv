I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app a couple times hoping the problem would fix itself but alas, it's just glitchy as hell.","[-0.26666666666666666, 0.6333333333333333]","[0.048, 0.795, 0.157]",1

"I don't know if Apple users experience the same, but for the Android, tumblr is very slow. Pictures take a while to load and videos buffer for a long time.
