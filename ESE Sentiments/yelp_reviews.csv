Yelp manipulates reviews in its own interest and in order to manipulate companies to join their ranks it's a phony company. Placing meaningless bad reviews by persons that are not even Customer of businesses on their site at the forefront and burying and eliminating innumerable good reviews by Customer to Yelp about these companies thus depriving consumers of access to really really good companies and leaving them vulnerab is' just another fifth rate worthless sight to bad .

"Duluth Georgia is growing in leaps and bounds. When my family and I moved here in 1988, from Atlanta, Duluth was a small bedroom community. What I couldn't find locally, I hit the yellow pages of the phone directory, and usually ended going back towards Atlanta , and more often as not, getting lost from poor directions. Fast forward to now, I can now find just about anything on yelp, and even get directions and maps. Sure beats looking for the landmark huge oak tree that sits on the left corner at the fork in the road.  5 stars","[0.06363636363636364, 0.3762626262626263]","[0.097, 0.872, 0.031]",3

"I've been using Yelp since the day it was released. Though some improvements can be made, that can be said about most all Apps. Yelp is always a great tool when I don't really know what I want to eat. But where it's been the greatest help, is when I'm travelling. Every time I'm in an area that I'm not familiar with, good ole Yelp is by my side to steer me in the right direction for my culinary needs!!! I always find a delicious eatery within moments after tapping that wonderful red icon.                                          So do yourself a favor and give it a go.

If you want something reliable and a company you can trust then RUN AWAY!!! I test drove a Toyota Tundra that had dirt blowing out all air ducts! And they wanted waaaayyy to much for it. Then I found a different vehicle in the back that wasnt ready to sell yet. So they said they would put me at the top of the list and contact me once it was ready for a test drive. Today they said they have been trying to contact me which is an outright lie and said because they hadnt heard back they sold the car.,"[0.15714285714285717, 0.32857142857142857]","[0.062, 0.863, 0.075]",2

I like yelp and use it frequently but i have realized it is also  falsely pretensed. The premise of this site is to get honest reviews from regular un paid customers so there can be no control of reviews from business owners. However yelp still has authority to block negative reviews if the business pays for their business account. I have seen it done many times and even done to me. Yelp will hide the negative reviews to the last page and post the good reviews to the top pages even if they aren't recent!,"[0.12727272727272726, 0.4175990675990677]","[0.119, 0.714, 0.166]",1

"it connects online reviews to the stupid app and if the app is out dated, you have to first update the app to get to the yelp review that you could have read online without all the fuss. It makes reading yelp reviews so annoying. And as an added bonus the app goes on an update weekely basis. And you have to update the stupid app to get to the review.

A hot fudge sundae is $2.09 sign say ask for nuts so i did and cool whip they said coolwhip comes on it well 7%tax on price would be around $2.24 well everytime i visit for same item peice is always different now $2.77 last time $2.23. Question is howdoes price change each visit i do not recommend anyone to go to sonics.  Dairy queen is around the conner and it is same price every time with hotfudge extra fudge coolwhip nuts and cherry total$ 2.33. Not a different price each time and rudness from window employee is sad. Sorry but the ones who bring it to your car are very very sweet but due to each visit the delivery employees loose their tip and they are very sweet to bad i will not come back . I have tried for 33 days now in 2 months so i have given fair chances. So please go to dairy queen or even Mcdonald and i truly do not like McDonald's but I will go to Dairy queen si I know I'm just one person but that a little more money for dairy queen.,"[0.031028846153846157, 0.5383782051282051]","[0.132, 0.777, 0.091]",1

Got there 10 minutes before drive thru closing. No one answered me or told me they were closing early. Sat there from 9:50 to 10 with all the lights on. Nobody said anything or told me they were gonna close the drive thru early. Pulled around to the front to re check the hours where I hear workers giggling and then all the lights go off. Very professional BK. Could've at learn told me you were closing instead of laughing. But it's BK..what do I expect.,"[0.11, 0.24333333333333332]","[0.064, 0.911, 0.025]",1
