"I (and a fair few from my research) am having troubles using the app due to my own and other peoples voices going ""robot"". I tested data usage, and it was using far less than it should have been, with my network being able to handle 10x (maybe more) the required amount (which was not being used) to avoid distortion. I found another issue with the app not using processing power, due to it being classed as ""low profile"" by my device.

If you're going to make a chat app at least give mods the bare minimal to function as moderators. We have a fair amount of minors in our Pokemon Go discord and 4 people came in posting explicit images to our screenshot sub channel but none of us could do a damn thing about it because no one on the Android app can ban users so this presisted for almost an hour before we could get anyone who had the iOS or desktop version to take care of it.

"Random crashes, the ability to fully manage a server on the Android app still isn't a thing, random bugs, and the fact that there still isn't video calling makes this a downgrade of Skype in some ways.

Having to friend request people that you previously shared a group with just to pm them is dumb.

I saw this post on Facebook well I was checking out discord and it said something about.....a rainbow color for roles and then an alternating color role where it goes red yellow green blue or something. I think that's an excellent idea. Also what if you could get a color code plug-in / update where you can do [(hex code)] (text) [(same hex)] I think it would be good for making text stand out when people are  spamming. But only high commanding roles can use it.  Like there would be a box that says enable hex,"[0.18444444444444444, 0.4072222222222222]","[0.112, 0.83, 0.058]",1
