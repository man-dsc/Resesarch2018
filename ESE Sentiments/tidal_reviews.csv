"I've been using TIDAL for several months and I do like it. My iPod stopped working and I haven't bothered replacing the battery yet. The app is sleek and easy to use, the music catalog is excellent, and overall I recommend it. However there are some problems, and improvements I would like to see (in case anybody at TIDAL actually reads these).     1. Ability to change ""home page"". It is annoying when I'm playing an album or playlist, and every time I need to close the app and return to it Tidal plops me back onto their ""What's New"" page. Then I have to take 3-4 steps to get back to my music.  2. Put MY music/albums/etc at the top. I don't listen to Tidal's genres or playlists.  3. Make it easier to switch shuffle on/off.  4. Fix bugs. Today my app is crashing after every song (it is up-to-date). I also have intermittent issues with blips during playback and certain songs refusing to play sometimes for days at a time (this happened to me with ""Woo"" off Rihanna's Anti album).","[0.13490751672569853, 0.39630066902794175]","[0.16, 0.778, 0.062]",1

"No Google cast support. I really can't believe it. I was so impressed by just about everything else, but not having Google cast support makes this a 1 star app. Your PR people keep saying it's in the works but seriously if this were my company my design team would not be going home until their was an update ready with GC support. You recognize the need for lossless audio in todays 128kbps world but you don't support the most widely used and cost effective way to get that high quality audio to a high quality DAC. Most home systems don't have native BT support so we are stuck with the crappy DAC in our phones or whatever Bluetooth receiver we use. Seriously. Fix this. And don't pretend hip hop is the only music people want to listen to. You are the only streaming service with an extreme   bias to one type of music. I'm really impressed with 95% of this app and hi-fi music is going to catch on, but it won't be with your company if you don't get on it.","[0.20855555555555552, 0.6875555555555555]","[0.163, 0.765, 0.072]",1
It has consistently gotten better and I am happy with the service,"[0.5166666666666667, 0.5833333333333334]","[0.423, 0.577, 0.0]",3
Yes the phone app and internet need a lot of work! Haha. But for out. There is no other service like this. I'm in love. I just bought am htc 10 with the 24bit and dac. That with this. Just can't mess with that audio quality coming from a phone. Tidal is just like Spotify but far far better quality and people the artists we love so much are actually getting payed. I'm more than happy to pay 24 bucks a month for this. So cheap! Love love love. The app will only improve with time. I look forward to it.,"[0.3264705882352941, 0.5794117647058823]","[0.367, 0.609, 0.024]",2
I signed up for the free trial. It worked great on my laptop but I was unable to access from my phone.,"[0.2333333333333334, 0.6833333333333332]","[0.207, 0.793, 0.0]",3
"1. Can't listen to Individual tracks offline (You have to add tracks to a Palylist just to listen to tracks offline.)  2. When albums are added to favorites album tracks aren't automatically added to your tracks section. Which creates an inconsistent experience. (I mean if all I wanted was my favorite tracks in the tracks section wouldn't I just create a favorites Playlist.)  3. My music section UI Needs to be more flexible(User should be able to customize what section they want to see first when they go into my music section. Not just take the user straight into the Playlist section not every user cares about Playlist. Me personally I would like to go straight into the tracks or Album section when I clicked on the my music section)  4. Also has a stupid gimmicky rotation to the album art in the now playing section(Doesn't let you enjoy the album cover art work, the only way of seeing the full album cover is by going into album info. Also the circular shape cut out of the album cover is inconsistent with the design of the rest of the app which is squared shapes \u0026amp; images with sharp edges. I mean remember your design principles people repetition creates consistency through out your design. I don't need the album cover to rotate in order to know the track is playing. The progress bar and the point that I hear it playing is enough.)","[0.06764705882352944, 0.5960784313725491]","[0.112, 0.834, 0.054]",2
I have tried all the big named music applications. This one is the best price for unlimited music and also has exclusives that the others don't.,"[0.5, 0.2]","[0.149, 0.851, 0.0]",2
