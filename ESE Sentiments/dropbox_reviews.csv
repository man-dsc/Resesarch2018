"Used to be that when selecting files or photos to post or share, you could select and post one, then reopen Dropbox and it opened right at the place you left. Now it defaults every time Dropbox is opened to wherever you were within Dropbox when the app was updated last year.

But maybe you can make the synchronization between the mobile app to the dropbox for pc, bcs i try to connect my phone to pc it is not working and says i need to log in, but everytime i log in it does not recognize my dropbox account in my phone. And also hope you fix the option to remember password and email account to login in case the user is forgetting their account password. Thx","[0.7, 0.6000000000000001]","[0.098, 0.902, 0.0]",3

Think about it, do you really want your entire drop box storage locally on your phone or tablet? No! However, once set, the only way to undo is to change 'available offline' to off on EACH file.

"I remain extremely frustrated with Dropbox for Android. On my Samsung tablet, when I access my dropbox, I can keep single files for access locally, but there appears to be no way to do this for entire folders; and the copy and move functions seem to be limited to copying or moving to other Dropbox locations.  If it were possible, and intuitively accessible, to store a whole folder locally, I'd give this app 5 stars; not having this feature renders it nearly useless for transferring files to a tablet unless you know you will have wifi access later.","[-0.0744047619047619, 0.2943452380952381]","[0.0, 0.887, 0.113]",1

I have used Dropbox  for a long time and like that photos from my camera are automatically uploaded. On 22/07/2016 this will change. Why? So users don't use up their free allowance. This implies we don't know how to do this for ourselves.

"The fact that Dropbox is now compelling its users to buy the full 1TB package is completely unreasonable.

Even if I take 100 pictures and videos a day, for example, I will never fill that amount of space completely.

This used to be a great app that was as convenient as could be but now it is clunky. The new share feature is bad and now it is not possible to view documents through Dropbox that your phone would otherwise not be able to.

Came pre-installed on my phone because of a deal with Samsung drop box is no longer honoring and I can't remove it Soni tried using it the free amount of data is useless to get more you have to pay 10 bucks a month or give them access to all your contacts everyone you invite gives you more space SCAM to get them more business.

"This app used to be great, now when I tag a file as offline on my Amazon kindle, it states it did, but later when I go to try to use it (without an Internet connection), it states that it has to connect to update the file and since it can't, you can't access it.

I feel ill-supported and uncomfortable keeping even my personal email or basic contact info linked to my account at this time.  They alert you saying a new login has occurred on an unfamiliar device, to include their location and IP address, yet they do not allow you to remove all connected devices or alter privacy or access of already connected computers even after changing your password. In addition, there is no security protocol in place that can help you once another has logged in, aside from writing their help center and waiting 2-3 business days while your account is compromised.  All it would take is a simple button, as programs and personal accounts of all kinds have these days, that would log out all devices to ensure security.","[-0.005303030303030307, 0.48639069264069246]","[0.114, 0.82, 0.065]",1
