"Taking notes on whatever device and sync them with all my other devices, is why I started using evernote. Now I have to pay for that. In itself that's fair enough.

The desktop version was great and the mobile versions had a lot less to offer but were slowly adding more features and were very user friendly and efficient.   Today I opened my app to find out that I can only use evernote on 2 devices without paying for it. I currently have it on 6. Sorry but you just lost a loyal user. I am NOT paying for something you gave me for free because you decided you need more money. I'm upset because I loved this app but I can go use my 16 gb of google drive and get more organization options for free.,"[0.2583333333333333, 0.6088235294117648]","[0.221, 0.723, 0.056]",3

"The interface has a few glaring violations of the ""rule of least surprise"". The worst is when I'm editing an existing note and tap the back button to return to the note list. It presents a dialog asking if I'm sure I want to proceed without saving the changes, and I'm given two choices: ""OK"", which will discard the changes, and ""Cancel"", which will return to the note. There's no option to save here, and the *affirmative* choice *deletes* my edits (jeez, if you're not paying attention...). Other apps either automatically save (which I would prefer in Evernote, and it does this for *new* notes), or ask if I want to save--not discard--the changes. Nope, in Evernote I have to reach up to the top left corner of the screen and tap the checkmark to save. Another annoyance is having to tap the edit button and then tap the text to edit a note. In other apps, simply tapping the text is sufficient to bring up the keyboard. A smaller issue is the left sidebar is essentially useless, since I can't actually navigate the notebook hierarchy from it--I have to choose ""Notebooks"" to get the same fullscreen list I get by just hitting the back button.","[-0.0007177033492822984, 0.3566093263461684]","[0.08, 0.842, 0.078]",1

It is awesome. You can carry everything of your office everywhere. Expect some improvements such as; 1. Merging duplicate notes with easy option -may be I haven't tried premium 2. Uploaded files on note go down at the bottom automatically so you can not insert next to your important  comment of your notes. It is hard to find when you have many attachment in one note even after tags.  3. Sometimes Sync skip latest updated note or download  so have to ensure it is uploaded 4. It needs own calendar or organizer rather than third party app so can be great user friendly for multi reminders set up in same note 5.more improvement expected for table contents. 6.May be income expense summery feature can be great.

"DO NOT create notes with this app that you plan on storing for a long time. I've been a daily user of this app for about a year. I've seen notes that were full of information just clear themselves for no reason and save as the most current. I try to pull up the old note full of information on another device in an attempt to bring the note back from the dead and failed. If you edit a note on different devices (My experience was PC and Android) you will have note conflicts all the time. When a conflict occurs, it's impossible to save the note with the correct information. I've lost shopping lists, recipes, to do lists,  just about everything. Evernote is absolute garbage.
