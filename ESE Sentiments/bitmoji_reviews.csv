"I like the app but I have two issues:  1. on Galaxy S7 you cant seamlessly switch between the Samsung Keyboard and the Bitmoji Keyboard.  2. When in an SMS text window, if you select the Bitmoji, it prompts you  if you want to send to an existing contact or a new contact. This is VERY INCONVENIENT. Instead it should behave just like other emojis and simply insert into the text window and then allow me to send.   If Im doing something wrong or have missed something on the install, please let me know.","[-0.1947727272727273, 0.5311147186147186]","[0.109, 0.773, 0.118]",2

I'm kind of conflicted...I think it's cool you can customize and create your emoji but then the options are kind of lacking. Plus why are all the hair styles so short???

While I love many aspects of this app I hate the lack of user support. I have had an issue since day one: being unable to create two person bitmoji with my boyfriend's avatar but being able to with others. Bitstrips have been no help in rectifying it. I have emailed them three times and have yet to receive a response that wasn't an auto-reply. This absence of care for the customer coupled with a lack of pride in their product has left me no recourse but to rate them with 1/5.

Bitmoji is awesome! It has all kinds of perfect personalized sayings with your avatar in them for texting and they're cute and funny and perfect for what you want to say. The app works great.

"Considering one if the avatar styles to choose from is BitStrips I was hoping it would have similar features. I personally would find it more fun if you could create your significant other or at least make up to one friend. I feel as though this would be more fun for the lovey-dovey emoji and it would be more fun in general because it would make the emojis more personable. The other feature I would suggest adding in is to be able to manually adjust features, sizing, spacing... etcetera.","[0.2183333333333333, 0.43]","[0.21, 0.79, 0.0]",1

The app really is great. I mean you can create your own avatar :D but the reason I won't rate it with 5 stars is that the app is horribly unstable. It keeps crashing at random times. I turned off my phone and restarted the app many times but it still kept crashing. So I wouldn't recommend downloading this app now. I would wait a bit until they release another update for this app fixing the issue.,"[0.15535714285714283, 0.7767857142857143]","[0.083, 0.783, 0.134]",3

It's a great app. It has a lot of memes for it... I guess that's what they would be considered. Pretty cool.

Also I would like if you could comment on people's post on Facebook with the Bitmoji instead of having to post something to use it.

"If it weren't for two things.  I subtracted one star because when I share my bitmoji most places the background gets filled in black and that makes it look horrible, there should be done fail safe to default to a white background if the app doesn't support transparency in images.

Before you were able to choose to open bitmoji from choosing insert image there you would find the option to open bitmoji. But now with the integration of the bitmoji keyboard there is no longer a way to open the app by navigating to  insert image. I can no longer use this app. If you open the bitmoji keyboard you are limited to only use that function of inserting bitmoji and you cannot type any text until you close it and then go back to your settings to open and choose your regular keyboard.,"[0.04285714285714286, 0.4344780219780219]","[0.0, 0.934, 0.066]",1

Why text words when you can use Bitmoji? I absolutely love using Bitmoji! It never gets boring because new Bitmojis show up all the time.

I wish there was an option to add a face mole since that's a predominant feature of mine and had an ability to select a specific text msg instead of having to start from scratch.

"Forcing  me to update. That is so low. The reason I didn't update is bcos I don't want to lose the floating icon, u moron. Bring back Bitstrips. Improvement on the search is great coz no need to scroll each one to find the right bitmoji.  Can improve further on the tag for much better search. A bummer on no shortcut. A huge troublesome without it! Bitstrips is better coz I can change background, face mood,  moves body parts.","[0.19841269841269843, 0.553968253968254]","[0.213, 0.608, 0.18]",2

I have to go through the app, choose the method of communication and if it's a text I have to select the people I want to text to, which makes it difficult to reply to a text message thread with multiple people. The apple users have an icon to enable the bitmoji keyboard.

Fun app. Love all the characters. But Samsung Galaxy and possibly android users can't get the bitmoji keyboard as an option to toggle to from the normal keyboard... this specifically is if you are doing a long running group text. Making it so you have to save the image and attach it like a picture to messages. That takes away from the ease of use. Otherwise to send to one person you can send from the bitmoji app which also is fine but would be better if it was within the message keyboard.,"[0.25952380952380955, 0.55]","[0.157, 0.843, 0.0]",3

It's pretty lame. ALSO...when I was in a group text it wouldn't let me send to whole  group.,"[0.05625, 0.47836538461538464]","[0.117, 0.836, 0.047]",2

"I have two other options for making custom emojis (besides drawing them myself), but this one is far simpler for the purpose than one and makes many more and far more fun pictures than the other. I still settled for 4 stars because I wish they gave me full control over my character's outfit. I know they technically could as the same company used to, and I haven't figured out why they aren't doing that anymore.
