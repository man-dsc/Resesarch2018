White Noise Lite,com.tmsoft.WhiteNoiseLite,"Do you have trouble going to sleep? Are you traveling on a plane and need a quick power nap? Does your newborn baby wake up in the middle of the night? There are numerous benefits to using White Noise: 

• Helps you sleep by blocking distractions 
• Relaxes and reduces stress 
• Pacifies fussy and crying babies 
• Increases focus while enhancing privacy 
• Soothes headaches and migraines 
• Masks tinnitus (ringing of the ears) 

Even when you’re asleep, your brain is constantly scanning and listening for sounds. If it’s too quiet, unwanted noises such as faucet drips or police sirens can interrupt your sleep. White Noise generates sounds over a wide range of frequencies, masking those noise interruptions, so you can not only fall asleep, but stay asleep.

""I often woke up about two in the morning and could not go back to sleep for love not money. Now with this app is easy to go back to sleep.""

""Insomnia went away with 1 use""

""I have been an insomniac all my life and to a point have learnt to live with it…on some occasions I get very frustrated with my mind for ‘jumping’ into alert state as soon as my head hits the pillow and it was on one of these occasions that I came across this app…I AM IN SHOCK!!In all my 41yrs I have never come across anything that has actually worked – I can honestly say this app has CHANGED MY LIFE!! I am now on night 7 of solid sleep and the more you listen the easier it gets – I thought I’d get bored of every night listening to the same voice saying the same thing but I actually look forward to plugging in my ear phones!! I am waking up more tired at the moment but in a different way – almost as if my body is relaxing in a way it never has so it’s finally starting to catch up on 41yrs of dreadful sleep deprivation!!""

NiteFan - White Noise Fan App,com.hitechmom.nitefan,"NiteFan is a white noise app that allows you to fall asleep to the sound of a fan.

Do you FANcy falling asleep to the sound of a fan? Well, that’s FAN-tastic! The sound of a fan is calming and blocks out other sounds in the room to help you fall asleep. You probably FANtasize about being about to take your fan with you when you travel, don’t you? Sometimes that’s just not possible. But never fear! If you’re a fan FANatic, this app is for you!

This app will allow you to choose between the sounds of 4 different fans to help you fall asleep when your head hits the pillow. Play one type of fan or mix them together to create your own custom fan sound. Mix characteristics to your fans such as clicks and wobbles. Add the sound of rain for a more relaxing mood.

Fan sounds include a box fan, an oscillating fan, an even-toned fan, and a fan that sounds like it's blowing the sheets. Extra characteristic sounds include clicks, rain, and electric wobbles.

The sounds will play in the background, so you can lock the screen of your phone and still hear the sounds as you fall asleep. The sounds will play until you stop them in the morning. No internet connection is required.

This is a great app to have when traveling because bringing a fan with you usually isn't usually feasible. It is also a great source of ambient noise that you can turn on whenever you need to work without distraction. And finally, it’s also a great way to just sit back and relax to a calming sound when you need to unwind. How does anyone sleep or relax or concentrate without NiteFan in their lives? We have no idea.",4.5,20
