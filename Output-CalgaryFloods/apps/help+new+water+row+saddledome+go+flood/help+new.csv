BPPV Self Help,uk.co.todaysnewidea.bvvp-exercises,"The BPPV exercise app is a mobile app developed by Today’s New Idea to assist sufferers of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) undertake a programme of Brandt-Daroff exercises that may have been prescribed as a self help/home treatment regime by their physician.

The Brandt-Daroff exercises are a highly successful treatment for sufferers of BPPV and are very easy to do at home. Unfortunately the exercise regime is quite long, typically two weeks, and the exercises themselves is a little convoluted and very repetitive.

The BPPV Self Help app has been design to help suffers of BPPV to assume the correct positions throughout the exercise while also helping track the users progress over the course of the exercise programme.

The app provides the following features:
* Motion detection to ensure you are in the correct position and orientation
* Timer functionality to ensure you hold the position for the required amount of time
* Visual and optional audio feedback telling you when to change position
* Notification reminders for missed exercise sessions
* Simple to understand graphs showing your progress to date
* Total privacy - your information never leaves your phone

We developed this app to help one of our colleagues who suffered from BPPV and we hope you find it helpful too!

Please note: While this app will run on the 12.9 inch version of the iPad we do not recommend you use this for this exercise treatment due to it's large size and weight. The 9.7 inch iPad is quite manageable though you will probably require two hands to hold it.

A New Earth

Awakening to your Life's purpose
Building on the astonishing success of The Power of Now, Eckhart Tolle presents readers with an honest look at the current state of humanity: He implores us to see and accept that this state, which is based on an erroneous identification with the egoic mind, is one of dangerous insanity.

Tolle tells us there is good news, however. There is an alternative to this potentially dire situation. Humanity now, perhaps more than in any previous time, has an opportunity to create a new, saner, more loving world. This will involve a radical inner leap from the current egoic consciousness to an entirely new one.
In illuminating the nature of this shift in consciousness, Tolle describes in detail how our current ego-based state of consciousness operates. Then gently, and in very practical terms, he leads us into this new consciousness. We will come to experience who we truly are—which is something infinitely greater than anything we currently think we are—and learn to live and breathe freely.",,
