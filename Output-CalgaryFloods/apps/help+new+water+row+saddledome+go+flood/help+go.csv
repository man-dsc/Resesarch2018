""Hudway is one of the cleverest driving apps we've seen""
— CNET

""Hudway app is unbelievably cool for one special reason: It actually lets you see your directions and route right on your windshield""
— USA Today

HUDWAY Go helps you drive safer in fog, rain, heavy snow, in dusk and darkness.

Create a route and place your smartphone on the dashboard — you’ll see the route reflected on your windshield. Keep your eyes on the road and know in advance what’s ahead — a straight run, or a ramp-turn. This is especially handy when driving between cities.

Features:
- Intuitive 3D map, simple navigation
- Voice Assistance
- Speed limits
- Long tap on the map to set the destination
- Fuel consumption calculation
- Transit points
- Search for addresses and POI
- Choose alternative routes
- Drive offline right after you start
- The app will recalculate the route if you leave it
- Classic GPS map navigation mode
- Head-up display (HUD) mode
- Trip info: ETA, speed, distance traveled, directions on the next manoeuvre, and more
- Based on OpenStreetMap (OSM)

Note: If you face any problems or find any bugs, please email us at support@hudwayapp.com or report the bug right from the app.

We appreciate your feedback!

Attention!
1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (learn more about it at hudwayglass.com). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.

2. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.

Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

GoLog - Activity Safety Timer,com.gologapp.golog,"Texting or updating friends and family of your whereabouts has evolved. GoLog is a simple, fast and private way to log any activity, its details and duration privately and without notification before or during an activity. Should you not end your activity, as planned, GoLog notifies selected contacts via SMS / text. This will occur even if your phone is off or no cellular coverage is available.

Our first notification is light and no details about your activity are given. It simply asks them to text or call you. GoLog is your confidant and only shares your activity details when and if necessary.

The second notification contains your activity details, including start and current GPS location. This information will be sent between 5 and 60 minutes later, depending on user settings. This delay allows users ample time to return from ‘Off the Grid’ activities such as hiking or boating.

WHY GOLOG?
Life’s an adventure and accidents and unforeseen everts occur daily. Are you prepared? Look at GoLog as your activity and adventure seatbelt. Before we journey off in a car, we buckle up. Not just when the weather is bad or we feel unlucky, every time. Why? Because there is no way to predict when an accident might occur.

With GoLog your prepared for life. Whether you use GoLog a little or a lot we can all agree that many activities we engage in have some risk factor. Anything from hiking, jogging at night to online dating. 

OFF THE GRID
This is our specialty! For activities such as hiking, boating or others that take you ‘Off the Grid’ or out of cellular coverage, GoLog is the answer. Once a user enters GoMode, or begins an activity, your activity details including your starting location are placed in our cloud. Our cloud-based system performs all messaging so your phone can be off, out of cellular coverage or otherwise disabled yet contacts receive your notifications.

INDEPENDENCE
GoLog promotes independence by allowing its users the ability to do activities alone yet still have the assurance that GoLog has your back!

HOW IT WORKS (under 10 seconds)
1. Choose Activity (Lifestyle or ‘Recreation)
 2. Record Voice Note (details of activity)
 3. Estimate Time (not meant to be precise, give or take)
       - You’re now in GoMode. Enjoy Activity!
4. End Activity by entering passcode (Notifications Cancelled)
        OR
5. Lite Notification Sent (Please call or text) if timer expires
6. 30 MinuteS Later - ACTIVITY DETAILS SENT


TRAVEL APP
GoLog is the perfect travel companion!  Recreation or business, we often find ourselves in situations very different from our everyday routine. GoLog works anywhere data coverage is available!

BOTTOM LINE
In an ever changing world, GoLog is a real world communications tool for the safety conscious or anyone who lives their life on the go. Whether its a single activity, or daily use, try it an you’ll soon be telling your friends and family to, “GoLog it!”

GOLOG CLOUD MESSAGING:

- Break free from debilitating thought patterns and avoidance strategies
- Develop self-esteem and self-confidence
- Experience newfound freedom and a zest for life

Do you want to be free of your fears and anxieties once and for all? Do you want to let go of the fear of being afraid? Do you wish to go back to living a self-determined life? By means of helpful suggestions, the program „Stop Fears To Go! Mental Training for Fears and Anxieties“ helps you examine your thoughts and feelings and develop new, fear-free patterns of thought and behavior so that you can significantly change your quality of life and the level of joy that you experience. You will also learn to be consciously aware of how you interpret an event or situation, so that you can look at what would have previously made you anxious or afraid from a new, more relaxed perspective. You will direct your attention away from what could happen and become independent of anxiety and its consequences.

HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS

The program „Stop Fears To Go! Mental Training for Fears and Anxieties“ works effectively by using the techniques of mental coaching and autosuggestion. The 20-minute program is aimed at adults who wish to learn how to minimize or even free themselves from their fears and to strengthen their self-esteem once more. Kim Fleckenstein first gives you important food for thought on the subject of fear and anxiety in the introduction. Next, you will hear empathetic spoken suggestions which will gradually anchor themselves deeply into your subconscious through conscious repetition. The program is designed in such a way that you can repeat the suggestions during a short pause. This allows you to further internalize what you hear, so that it works on you both mentally and psychologically.

Kim Fleckenstein is a certified alternative practitioner in psychotherapy, a clinical Hypnotherapist and NLP-Master-Coach.

Tips for Pokemon Go - Free Tips and Guide,com.vocado.TipsPokemonGo,"Tips for Pokemon Go

Pokémon Go wants you to get up on your feet and venture into the real world. The only way to find Pokemon is by wandering around outside. Using your phone’s GPS signal, the game tracks where you are, and will spawn Pokemon for you to capture based on your location. In town, grass- and normal-type Pokémon will often appear. If you go near water or out at night, however, you’re likely to encounter water-based and psychic Pokémon, respectively. That said, people have run into water Pokémon in locations without water nearby, so it’s not entirely based on your geographical location.
