Draw bright, bold strings of color, connecting pairs of matching endpoints. The length of each path must match the numbers on the two endpoints that it connects. The length of each path is the number of cells it passes through. Big or little, each cell along the path counts as 1 unit of length. Draw backwards or double tap to correct mistakes. There's only one way to do it, and all squares will contain a piece of a path when the puzzle is solved. Finish solving to see the miniature picture that you have created. 

Two ways to navigate while solving: 
---Tap the zoom button for an overview, then touch the screen where you want to play next. 
---Pan to show another area of the board. Put your finger down on any cell WITHOUT A NUMBER and move it around. Simple, intuitive, fast.

THEY SAY ABOUT US

""I lost track of my water intake throughout the day, and this is the perfect way to keep up with it. I love the way you can customise it""

""Wouldn't have thought it would change my behaviour so much, but it has. The gasification of drinking water... Who's have thought? And competing daily with my husband always helps!""

""I started looking for water intake apps because I had a kidney stone. This one is excellent and the best I found! I love the simple design and it is very easy to use. You can customise 2 different cup sized and there is a calendar that tracks your progress. Oh and the tracker now shows you if you drank more than your goal, although it doesn't show it on the calendar. My favourite part is the reminders. You can tell it during what times you want to be reminded and also how often. And all of this is free! Really excellent app and recommended for everyone!""",4.5,92
