ARISE | Get Help Now,"The 1930's brought tough times to the United States. During this time the Government created programs to help the less fortunate. Over the years many programs have been added to help families get food, find work, and help the most vulnerable within our society. The intent behind the programs are noble; however, the methods supporting them are antiquated. Since the inception of these programs we have gone to the moon, invented the internet and the personal computer yet the social safety net has largely gone unchanged.

ARISE is changing the way people view the social safety net.  We are connecting people in need with those who can help through our mobile technology by making communities more responsive to social emergencies, natural disasters, and everyday needs that we all face. We call it crowd-service. 

Crowd-Service is when neighbors unite to help each other organically. Just like crowd-funding, small amounts of service will add up to large efforts by communities. When a social emergency hits neighbors and non-profits can respond much faster than current social safety net and response structures in place today. 

Users can request help, provide assistance to each other, and read about success within their community. Calls for help can be as simple as raking the leaves, moving a sofa, grabbing a bag of groceries for a single mother, or donating clothes. This solution will: 
* Draw attention to local causes 
* Battle the growing addiction epidemic by building authentic community involvement  
* Empower 'Start-Up' cause organizations by providing free technology  
* Pivot quickly to address the issues of the day – not waiting for a vote or budget cycle  
* Show the world what individuals, cause organizations, churches, and businesses are doing to make an impact.

As a Nation we witnessed the success of crowd-service after Hurricane Harvey devastated the Gulf Coast of Texas. The need was so intense that the 911 system went down. Individuals would call out for help on Facebook, Twitter, and other channels. Neighbors, volunteers, and cause organizations spontaneously coordinated relief efforts and helped each other.

help yourself - find yourself,"Full version of the successful 120 days program to health, inner balance and vitality. A 120-days project that will change your life completely, it leads to joie de vivre, to health and prosperity, to self-confidence and self-esteem, to inner strength and power. Embark on the way to the most important person in your life, to yourself. At the end of the road you will be rewarded with a charisma and an inner balance that you have never thought possible. 

Have you ever asked the question why your life is what it is today? What is your life, what is your perception of it, what are your feelings? I will tell you:
Your life consists of your personal PERCEPTION OF LIFE, which you create yourself. Your perception of life is the result of your thoughts and feelings and nothing else. You are what you think you are. You think about 40,000 thoughts each day; most of them unconsciously and, further more, the same thoughts over and over again. You create your entire perception of life by what you think. Also each disease is firstly created on a spiritual level before it becomes visible on the body, like a building that is firstly created in the spirit before the first brick is set for it. Find out the psychological components of your diseases. What is the false and untrue thought-pattern that triggers the disease on your physical level. If you do not correct this thought-pattern, it manifests itself in the body, usually by worsening diseases. The aim of this program is to teach you to recognize wrong and untrue thoughts and remove them from your mind vocabulary. This will change your life completely. It will bring you to yourself, to inner balance, which is the basis for a healthy mind and body. It will lead you to pleasure and joie de vivre, which is the basis for happiness. It will give you self-confidence, trust and inner strength, which is the basis for prosperity. It is a new and exciting way on which you embark. It is the path to the most important person in your life, to yourself and to a joy of life that you have not previously thought possible. You decide whether you want to start on this path.

How does the program work?             
By answering a few questions about your daily routine, an individual program is created for you. This program will accompany you during the next 120 days and will send you information that helps you to gradually achieve your aim, to become your true self. It will ensure that you remain on your new path. And this path will be exciting and interesting and you will see that you meet more and more smiling people, because you are going to develop a new charisma that will be interesting and attractive to others. You will change your life completely. You will realize that you are free in your decisions and that you are always free to re-select. You will respect yourself and you will achieve things, that you have always longed for, as easily as you are not able to imagine by now.","[['project'], ['joy', 'life'], ['person', 'important'], ['life', 'result'], ['thoughts', 'feelings'], ['life', 'question'], ['trust'], ['strength', 'basis'], ['inner'], ['health'], ['disease', 'physical'], ['becomes', 'visible'], ['aim'], ['program'], [], [], [], ['interesting', 'attractive'], ['charisma']]","[['A', 'life', '120-days', 'change'], ['person'], ['path', 'way'], ['perception', 'thoughts'], ['nothing', 'result', 'life', 'perception', 'feelings'], ['asked', 'today', 'ever', 'asked', 'question'], ['strength', 'self-confidence', 'inner', 'give'], ['prosperity', 'inner'], ['strength', 'self-confidence', 'power', 'self-esteem'], ['prosperity', 'balance', 'self-confidence', 'inner'], ['level', 'triggers'], ['body', 'level'], ['teach', 'The', 'program', 'diseases', 'usually', 'worsening', 'diseases'], ['This', 'health', 'days', 'created', 'created', 'spiritual', 'level'], ['daily', 'individual', 'way', 'routine', 'new', 'exciting'], ['decisions', 'self', 'free', 'become', 'true', 'realize'], ['people', 'joie', 'leads', 'completely', 'meet', 'smiling'], ['charisma', 'others'], ['new', 'rewarded', 'develop', 'road']]"

Rest Relax Reflect - Calm Down,"• Rainfall, Snowfall, Fireplace, Thunderstorms & Space Travel 
• 5 Different Scenes For Each Category 
• Real High Quality Sound Effects and Backgrounds(except Space Travel…maybe?) 
• Sound Tone and Animation Level Options 
• HD Retina Resolution Design 
• No Annoying Sound Loop Pauses or Clicks 
• Black & White Option for Every Scene 

Turn off the TV, put down the controller, log off of the social networks, grab your drink of choice, find a comfortable area to sit or lay down, open up this app. 

Rest, Relax, and Reflect with real rainfall, snowfall, thunderstorms, fireplaces, or simulated space travel. 

Each category has 5 different scenes with 4 different sound tone and animation level options. You can also strip the color out and transform any scene into black & white with the press of a button. Real sound effects, HD graphics, real background scenes(except space travel....maybe), and no annoying loop pauses. I almost fell asleep several times while developing and testing this app. It easily helped me relax even when I wasn't trying to. If you like the sound of nature with rain, snow, storms, and/or fire then you will probably enjoy this app. This app doesn’t only provide sound though, it also performs as a simulator by having animations.

There's also no internet connection required after downloading it. So you can enjoy the scenes without worrying about streaming anything and using data. You can also turn the animations off and just enjoy the audio, or turn the audio off and just stare into the relaxing animated simulations. For the full experience set a sound tone and animation level and enjoy both at the same time. Rest, Relax and Reflect is one of the best relaxation simulation apps on the App Store. Use this app for meditation, relaxation, lowering blood pressure, reducing stress, help falling asleep, as a nature simulator, and more. 

Rest, Relax, and Reflect isn't just an app though, it's an experience. Embrace it.

DiabetesScS,"My Diabetes Success ™

“The most important story we will ever write in life is our own…not with ink, but with our daily choices.”

Nathan Hurst’s Journal in the book, THE GIFT, by Richard Paul Evans, p. 104 (www.richardpaulevans.com)

Choices & Patterns Inc. offers you a personal general health and diabetes management program.  It helps you fit diabetes management into your daily living routine.
 
Here’s the secret to making your daily management easier:

Routine and timing are important in coordinating daily meals, activities, exercise and medications to achieve blood glucose levels in your target zone.  A strategy to prevent burn-out and fatigue is to build daily management patterns around your usual meals, snacks, activities, exercise and medication.  Learn what achieves blood glucose values within your target range. Then take blood glucose levels when you introduce something new into your routine or your day such as eating out at a new restaurant.

Use the Tips Module to guide you on how to time patterns to prevent becoming tired or bored with gathering your diabetes management information every day.  Choices of food, activity (including exercise) and management are entered by touch, voice, text and/or camera on your smart phone, your information is conveniently highlighted to give you immediate information on the results of your choices.

The beauty of the program is that it takes less than a minute to both enter and receive information in three easy steps.  You have the opportunity to spot problems early and respond immediately to correct problems and stay on course.
