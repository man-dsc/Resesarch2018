""I love this so much and want to say thanks! I have spent years finding it extremely difficult to sleep ect and for the first time in what feels like forever I have had a few really good nights sleep thx to this app! Would recommend to all""

""I often woke up about two in the morning and could not go back to sleep for love not money. Now with this app is easy to go back to sleep.""

""Insomnia went away with 1 use""

""I have been an insomniac all my life and to a point have learnt to live with it…on some occasions I get very frustrated with my mind for ‘jumping’ into alert state as soon as my head hits the pillow and it was on one of these occasions that I came across this app…I AM IN SHOCK!!In all my 41yrs I have never come across anything that has actually worked – I can honestly say this app has CHANGED MY LIFE!! I am now on night 7 of solid sleep and the more you listen the easier it gets – I thought I’d get bored of every night listening to the same voice saying the same thing but I actually look forward to plugging in my ear phones!! I am waking up more tired at the moment but in a different way – almost as if my body is relaxing in a way it never has so it’s finally starting to catch up on 41yrs of dreadful sleep deprivation!!""

Sleep Sounds HQ: 600+ relaxing natural sounds & ambient white noise to help fall asleep,"* As seen on CNN, Lifehacker, and Engadget.com * 

Fall asleep fast to over 600 high-quality full-stereo recordings from around the world.

• ""It is one of the best apps I have used to keep me calm and to go to sleep"" - V lovelyu -

• ""Lull me into relaxing! -Downloaded last night and easily selected sounds to make a custom mix of favorites: chimes, rain and a really cool ""celestial"" sound. The choices are many and are super good quality. I've had a hard time finding an app of sounds that were good and not so cliche."" - ElizGoetz

• ""Beautiful app -Not only are the sounds fabulous, the photos are incredible. Easy to use, elegant interface. Great app!"" - WebbyHess19

Sleep deeply every night, and wake up feeling fresh and energized.

Sleep Sounds HQ gives you immediate access to a massive catalog of high-quality, naturally recorded sounds.  Much better than synthetic sounds and short repetitive loops, these are real-world sounds with all the richness, texture, and nuance of the natural environment. 

Imagine falling asleep to soft rain on a Bali rice terrace, a Himalayan stream, Red Sea waves, South African crickets, a warm crackling campfire, or enchanting wind chimes. 

Or … if you prefer the steady hum of 'white noise’, fall asleep to a steady blizzard, Swiss waterfall, the drone of a Dutch highway, a working flour mill, dishwashers and spinning washing machines, or pure white, pink, and brown noise. 

You will fall asleep fast and wake up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.

What's more, Sleep Sounds HQ can be used anytime you need to block out the outside world:
• Increase your ability to focus and be creative at work by removing distractions.
• Soothe your baby or small children and create a peaceful sanctuary for you and your family.
• Transform your hotel room into a familiar sleep oasis by blocking out noisy neighbors, ice machines, and elevator doors.
• Create a calm and tranquil environment for meditation and yoga.

With over 600 high-quality audio tracks to choose from, fine-tune a collection of sounds to your individual taste.

And if that isn't enough, you can create your own personalized mixes for sleep, work, travel, nap time, or meditation, blending up to 6 sounds at a time.

Improve your sleep, your health, and your sense of well-being starting tonight.
