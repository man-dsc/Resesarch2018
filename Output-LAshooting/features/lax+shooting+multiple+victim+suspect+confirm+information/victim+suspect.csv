MyFI (field interviewing for law enforcement),"Field interviewing for law enforcement taken to a whole new level.

SSL Storage. Field interviews are stored on a secure server for web access and retrieval if the user switches devices.

Photos. Take pics of tattoo, vehicles, persons, acquaintances, etc. and attach them to the FI card. Remember a face but not a name? Remember a vehicle but not a license plate? Search the photo library.

AirPrint. You don't need to install a driver or configure the printer queue. Tap print, select the printer that supports AirPrint, and print. It's that simple.

Search. FI card fields are searchable. Searching for someone that is bald, with green eyes, and a member of MS-13? Place those identifiers in the search field to locate potential suspects.

GPS. Remember a location but not the person? Need to compare locations to a crime map? Search pinned interview locations on a map to determine possible suspects.

Browser Access. Users can access their Fi-Cards via the web. Users can view, print, share, download, and delete FI-Cards from http://myfieldinterview.com

Email. Fi-Cards can be shared between users in-app or via email with the options of HTML or PDF format.","[['locate', 'potential'], ['install'], ['printer', 'select'], ['retrieval', 'user'], ['stored', 'secure'], [], ['enforcement'], ['tattoo', 'vehicles'], ['locations', 'crime'], ['someone', 'Searching']]","[['field', 'suspects', 'identifiers', 'search', 'field'], [""n't"", 'need', 'driver', 'configure'], ['print', 'supports', 'configure', 'printer', 'queue'], ['switches', 'access', 'user', 'switches', 'devices'], ['interviews', 'server', 'server', 'web', 'access'], ['Fi-Cards', 'users', 'license', 'plate', 'vehicle', 'shared'], ['taken', 'law', 'whole', 'interviewing'], ['persons', 'pics', 'vehicles', 'persons', 'acquaintances'], ['map', 'compare', 'locations', 'map', 'determine'], ['bald', 'searchable', 'bald', 'green', 'eyes']]"
