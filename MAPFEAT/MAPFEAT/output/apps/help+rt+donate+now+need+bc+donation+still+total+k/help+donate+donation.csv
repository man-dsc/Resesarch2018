Donate a Photo - a free charity app,com.jnj.donateaphoto,"Donate a Photo, the free donation app from Johnson & Johnson takes your photos and turns them into a way to do good. For every photo you share through Donate a Photo, Johnson & Johnson will donate $1 to the charity of your choice. 

Your photos can do things like help a newborn breathe with Save the Children, get school supplies for a girl in Guatemala with Girl Up, or help a deployed service member call home with the USO. 

Here’s how it works:
1.Choose a charity you want to help.
2.Take a picture with your mobile device (through the Donate a Photo app or choose one from your camera roll).
3.Share it (It’ll go in the Donate a Photo gallery and you can post it for all your friends to see on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram).
4.Johnson & Johnson gives $1 to your cause.

You can donate one photo a day, every day. And when your friends see your photos in their feeds, they’ll get inspired to help, too. So you can all raise more money and awareness and help your causes meet their goals even faster—and it's free.

Johnson & Johnson has curated a list of trusted charitable causes, and when a cause reaches its goal, or its donation period ends, a new cause gets added. Even if a cause doesn’t reach its goal, Johnson & Johnson will still give a minimum donation.

You can track all the causes you’ve helped, see what your photos have helped do, and get notified when your causes reach their goals or when a new cause is added.

It’s never been easier to help the causes you care about. It's free—so get the app and get started.

Mobile Disaster Relief,com.sirqul.mdrt,"This application is for first responders, aid scouts, and centers that are interested in providing resources, food, and help to those who have suffered through a disaster.

First Responders
----------------
1. Open app and record your location.
2. Take photos and record audio so that others get a clear understanding of what aid is needed.
3. Write notes and publish.

Aid Workers & Scouts
--------------------
1. Canvas the areas that you have been assigned.
2. Choose your location and record the situation.
3. Record via your own voice what is needed and how many people will need aid.
4. Publish and move on to your next location.

Aid Coordinators
------------------
1. Publish your location, as most are mobile and transient.
2. Record what items, resources, and services you are providing.
3. Update your location/information often as more supplies and resources are handed out.
4. Expect people to get notified and arrive based upon your updates!

The idea of the application is help organize efforts and connect those in need with those who are trying to help.

1. Setup public and private teams that can receive notifications and alerts, as well as chat in real-time.

2. Allow people to subscribe to alerts and notifications tied to an aid worker, a scout, and/or a aid center.

3. Publish images/audio and descriptions to FB so that you can get others outside your area to stay up-to-date with the work that is being done on the ground. This humanizes the event, as only some of the details will be picked up by local news and agencies.

We built this app so that we can have the greatest impact, since our solution works on mobile devices vs. being web-driven.",,

Music For Relief: Charity Donation App,org.musicforrelief.donateapp,"Join your favorite bands, celebrities and the global music community to support disaster relief and protect the environment with the Music for Relief app.

From as little as $5 a month added to your monthly cell phone bill, together our community can be the change.

Linkin Park began Music for Relief because they believed they could rally fans and the wider music community to make a difference.

So far we've raised an incredible $9 million for survivors of multiple natural disasters and planted over 1.3 million trees.

As Brad Delson says ""This is our way of giving back to the people who so desperately need it"".

WHY USE MUSIC FOR RELIEF?

MUSIC CAN CHANGE THE WORLD

Music for Relief has two immediate goals and is already making a big impact. The first goal is to respond to natural disasters as they occur to help survivors recover and rebuild. The organization also recognizes the environmental consequences of global climate change, which has demonstrated the capability to accelerate and strengthen certain types of natural disasters. Therefore the second goal of Music for Relief is to mitigate damage caused by natural disasters by reducing greenhouse gasses and educating the public about climate change.

With the app it's now easier than ever to help Music for Relief achieve their goals.

THE POWER OF CROWD IS REVOLUTIONARY

Imagine if everyone at the last big concert you attended gave just $5 via the app…

50,000 fans could easily raise $250,000 in one night – for the cost of less than a beer each.

That's enough money to provide clean water for 7,142 families following Hurricane Matthew.

That's enough money to build 2,000 sanitation facilities for the victims of Nepal's 2015 Earthquake.

And that's enough money to plant a quarter of a million trees!

SMALL ACTIONS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE

A little app and a $5 donation doesn't sound like much, but when a community bands together, it adds up to a world-changing difference.

As Jimi Hendrix once said; ""Music doesn't lie. If there is something to be changed in this world, then it can only happen through music.""  

And if our community don't do something, then who will?

If you've ever wanted to do more to help others, it's now easier than it's ever been.

How the app works: In a few taps you can add a small donation to your monthly cell phone bill; you can manage this through the app to keep in touch and see the difference your gift makes.",,
