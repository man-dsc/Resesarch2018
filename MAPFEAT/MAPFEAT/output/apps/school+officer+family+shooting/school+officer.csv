"ASSET: Arrest, Search, and Seizure Electronic Tool",edu.unc.sog.asset,"Spring 2013 Update. ASSET’s February 2013 update includes dramatically expanded treatment of search and arrest authority pertaining to probationers and other supervisees as well as more citations to landmark cases throughout. Furthermore, ASSET is now optimized for the iPhone 5 and the latest version of iOS! Many thanks to the North Carolina Department of Public Safety and the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association for supporting the update and keeping ASSET free.

Overview. ASSET (Arrest, Search, and Seizure Electronic Tool) gives North Carolina law enforcement officers, and other criminal justice professionals, fast access to the law of investigation. This app contains vital information about the legal issues officers confront every day, from search warrants to Terry stops to GPS tracking. 
 
The legal information contained in ASSET is the work of UNC School of Government faculty member Jeff Welty, a recognized expert in the law of search and seizure who regularly trains judges, lawyers, and officers in the subject.
 
Features:

•Navigation: Users can navigate ASSET using an intuitive table of contents as well as a search function. 

•Bookmarks: ASSET keeps track of recently researched topics and allows the user to bookmark frequently used information. 

•Offline Viewing: Once the app is downloaded to a device, virtually all of the content is available for offline viewing. The app can be used in remote areas or inside secure facilities where cellular networks or WiFi may not be available. 

•Updates: ASSET will be updated periodically as the law changes. The app was last updated on February 15, 2013.

Best of all, ASSET is free. It isn’t a “free trial” or a “free version” with minimal functionality that encourages the user to purchase a paid version – it is completely free of charge, thanks to the generous support of the School of Government Foundation, the North Carolina Department of Public Safety, and the North Carolina Sheriff’s Association.

Users should be aware that ASSET is a quick reference for frequently used information. It is not intended as a substitute for a comprehensive legal reference, such as Robert L. Farb’s book Arrest, Search, and Investigation in North Carolina. Nor is it intended to provide legal advice or to substitute the advice of a law enforcement agency's attorney.

Additional Information. The School of Government offers a wide range of other criminal law resources, many of which are also free of charge. For more information about these resources, please visit the School’s home page, the School’s criminal law page, the School’s publications page, and the North Carolina Criminal Law Blog.

2018 SASSAOA Annual Conference,com.eventsair.dbusiness.sassaoa2018,"Annual Conference 2018 – Seeds For Success

Welcome to the 2018 SASSAOA Annual Conference - Seeds For Success!  A diverse range of workshops and plenary sessions are on offer with a sustainability and environmental focus.

Amanda Blair is our MC this year and the conference kicks off with networking and Meet and Greet the sponsors early Sunday evening.  We are back at the Hilton Adelaide with the formal dinner at the beautiful Adelaide Town Hall.  VIP Department for Education corporate staff will again attend the formal dinner, along with the Principals Association representatives and sponsors. 

Workshop options on day one include: Jan Webber - 3 aspects of well-being which lead to positiveness; physical, mental and spiritual well-being, including the power of the mind.  We also have workshops about application writing, successful grant writing, managing testing parents and visitors, infrastructure, ‘dressing to impress’, archiving and environmental programs.

Day two brings plenary sessions that will include the latest information about EMS, ICT, Ethical procurement and Department for Education environmental issues and agency partners.  The AGM will also be held, and the Management Committee have some very exciting news to launch.  Amanda Blair will wrap up the conference with a Keynote.

Feedback in recent times has included catering for ancillary staff who do not have a management role in Finance or HR.  To address this professional development gap, we are running alongside our conference, a day long plenary on Monday.  The program for the additional seminar will include Medication and Heath Care Management, EMS information, and Application Writing.  Amanda Blair will MC and present a Keynote.

We are looking forward to this changed Conference format that is aimed at meeting a wider range of professional development needs and encouraging wider networking.  

However, without sponsors, our conference would be impossible to run at a cost effective price.  We sincerely appreciate and thank our sponsors.

Please enjoy your time spent at our annual conference as an opportunity to network, learn, affirm your knowledge and share best practice with colleagues.",,
