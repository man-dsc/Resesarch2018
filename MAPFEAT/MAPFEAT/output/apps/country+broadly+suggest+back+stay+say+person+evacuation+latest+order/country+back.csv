Trace Adkins,com.fluidesign.mobileroadie.1543,"The Official iPhone App of TRACE ADKINS. Adkins continues to conquer new worlds. He has long been country music’s alpha male, a man whose commanding presence and once-in-a-generation baritone have made him a pillar of the contemporary Nashville sound. But such are his other gifts—a restless intellect, wide-ranging interests, great ability as a communicator — that it was perhaps inevitable that his influence would spread well beyond the bounds of the genre.

In the past decade, Trace has made his mark as an actor, both on television and in the movies, an author, a voiceover artist and commercial spokesman, a social commentator, and a reality show participant. His effect on businessman and showman Donald Trump was such that after his initial and highly successful appearance on Celebrity Apprentice, he was invited back as a boardroom advisor. He has turned his entertainingly articulated views into a well-received book, A Personal Stand: Observations and Opinions from a Freethinking Roughneck, and has even inspired an action comic book series, Luke McBain, that has proven to be one of the genre’s hottest sellers.",5.0,21
