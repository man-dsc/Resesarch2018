Mad Racers Free - Australia Car Racing Cup,com.sfg.madracers,"Do you ever dream of being a professional race driver? Is racing in your DNA? If the answer is yes, then here is a game meant just for you. Mad Racers gives you a chance to jump behind the wheels and start racing. 

The game has different levels that you go through as you yourself grow in experience and of course, credits. As you race, for your performance you are awarded credits. You need certain amount of credits to unlock newer challenges and races. You also need them to buy your car from different options available. Obviously, the better ones would need higher number of credits, just like the more challenging races require for being unlocked. 

Key Features: 
- Realistic 3D Car Physics 
- Stunning 3D Graphics 
- 3 Different camera angles 
- Different car control options (buttons/arrows, tilt) 
- 4 awesome looking cars with various characteristics 
- Plenty of engine roars and tire burns 

You could actually buy multiple cars if your credit fund is sufficient and choose any one from them for racing. You could always choose a convenient camera angle that suits you best for driverâ€™s view; it could be the real life like inside the car view or other views as you will find in the options. 

The races are challenging and the controls require expertise. You do get credits for finishing 2nd or 3rd in a race too; but the highest credits are for winning the race. After all, winner takes it all!
