Law School Basics,com.mobiappslab.lawschoolbasics,"Law School Basics puts you in the know about everything the author wishes he had known before entering law school. It presents a thorough overview of law school, legal reasoning, and legal writing for students considering becoming lawyers or who will be entering law school.

""This app is worth having simply so you can quote real opinions written in the style of Genesis or Mark Twain. It also points out amusing cases — talking cats leap to mind — that might otherwise be buried by their more serious brethren. The chapters on how the court systems work, what memoranda should look like, and what certain legal terms mean are easy to understand, and it’s useful to have them all in one place. I didn’t care for the many pages on why law school is run the way it is, but you might be interested. Overall, it’s a practical handbook and a great reminder that law is not as serious a business as everyone seems to think.""",,
