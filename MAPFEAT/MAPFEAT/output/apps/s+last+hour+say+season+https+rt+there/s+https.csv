NOTE: Intercepting HTTP/S connections on cellphone networks requires the installation of a configuration profile. Due to the limited amount of time iOS applications can run in the background, Peek will eventually goto sleep and it will not be able to forward data to the cellular network. You can either relaunch Peek or manually remove this profile in the iOS settings app (General -> Profiles -> Peek Cell Data Interception -> Remove profile). You can, of course, reinstall the profile from Peek. This limitation also applies when you configure your WiFi proxy settings to 127.0.0.1 Simply relaunch Peek or switch off the proxy in your device's WiFi settings.",,
