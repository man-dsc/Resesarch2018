Qavartaliyartuk,com.afognak.MMA0008a,"When a 'bear' enters Milly and Molly's tent, they prepare to die! 

The Milly, Molly adventure stories promote the acceptance of diversity and the learning of life skills, and deal with the kinds of questions and challenges that children face every day. 

Theme: Courage and Determination 

This and other books in the series are the very first interactive storybooks written and narrated entirely in the Cup'ik language of Western Alaska. They provide an excellent foundation for learning to read and speak Cup'ik at any age. These books are a direct outcome and an excellent example of a collaborative partnership between the Association of Alaska School Boards and its membership. 

People love being able to run their fingers over the text to hear the story and touch any word to hear it said. They will happily spend hours coloring in the book and they can record themselves as well. 

You will be amazed at how these wonderful children's stories come to life with QBook.
