WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING
• “CircleBack lets you sit back as it does the real-time contact updates and management for you.” iphoneappsreviewonline.com
• “Simple, Powerful, intuitive — I didn't realize there was an app out there that could help me to get rid of duplicates and keep my contacts up to date. It shows me when clients leave a company and their new contact info. How does it know. It's a great app.” Review left on App Store 
• “Very Useful Complement To Apple's Contacts App — By allowing this app access to FB, Google Contacts and Contacts on your macOS and iOS, you'd imagine chaos would ensue. This app, though, is smart enough to detect possible duplicates, point out that a Contact is incomplete, and brings order to your Contacts. No nagware or annoyware, it works behind the scenes and about once a week taps you on the shoulder and politely says, ""hey, have a look at these Contacts - what can I do to make them less confusing?"" That's a good app to have…” Review left on App Store 
• “Great & Simple App— CircleBack is a great free app for managing your contacts effortlessly. The interface is very simple and easy to use. CircleBack searches its database for updated contact information and asks if you wish to accept or reject the changes/additions. It also gives you the option to update only specific information. Finally, CB keeps an up-to-date backup of all of your contacts in the cloud, giving users the peace of mind that their phone contacts are safe and secure no matter what happens.” Review left on App Store
