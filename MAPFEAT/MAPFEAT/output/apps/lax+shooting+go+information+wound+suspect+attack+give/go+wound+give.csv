GivnGo,com.givngocorp.givnGo,"What we are:
GivnGo is a mobile platform which allows users to donate to their favorite charities, schools, and other non-profit organizations. Our motive is to make the world a better place by making charitable donations a part of everyday life. Our ideology is simple: “By sharing your spare change, you can make the world change.”

How it works:
We have many donation options including one time donations and a monthly recurring option. However, our featured function is called ""Round Ups,"" which allows users to give back every time they make a purchase by donating their spare change. To start ""round ups"" just link your main card of purchase (credit or debit) and enter your corresponding bank information. For example, link your chase bank account with your chase visa card. The GivnGo platform will track your transactions and accumulate all your spare change for a given month. This total dollar amount will be sent to the charity(ies) of your choosing at the end of every month. You can also set limits on how much you donate per month allowing users to adjust contributions to their own personal financial desire/ability. Watch your pot of gold increase every month as you give, and see how a little change, can make a big difference for others! 

Extra:  
We like to call the spare change ""Karma Coins"" and we hope they work in just that way. So every time you shop for some new clothes, buy something to eat,  or fill up your gas tank,  you are also making an impact on others. This allows you to truly, give and go!",5.0,20
