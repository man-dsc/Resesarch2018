Hello Now by Hello Claims,com.livegenic.self-service.hellomyclaim,"Hello Now is a live video streaming desktop assessment app that allow Assessors Insurers and Repairers to see what the policyholder sees during the very first contact  over the phone. Using Hello Now, claim consultants are able to view the policyholders motor claim remotely and in real time through a live video stream, providing an early look into the size, scope and type of damage – directly benefiting insurers through significant cycle time reductions, cost reductions and improved policyholder satisfaction.

Hello Now is a proven solution designed to run with iPhone functionality, allowing policyholders to remain on the call with the claims consultant, while being able to deliver real-time visuals that ensure an accurate and speedy FNOL, triage and assessment for motor insurance claims.

Feature include:
•	Simple and easy to use
•	Simultaneous use of phone and visual stream
•	Cloud based recording and storage/replay options
•	Multi-channel sharing of visual stream
•	Ubiquitous access to real time stream on any internet connected device
•	Adapted for highest quality video at connection speeds and device capabilities over 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi
•	Visual stream privacy and sharing configuration based on the business needs
•	Enterprise level support
•	Metadata and analytics

The traditional adjuster and assessing process takes days and even weeks from receipt of claim to submission of report, whereas the Hello Now process can compete these steps on simple low value claims in under 24 hours.

Hello Now delivers a faster better and more accurate collection of loss information which then, if plugged into the Hello Now Insurer platform, can directly connect the claims consultant to immediate emergency mitigation service providers to further reduce motor damage before an assessor is even required to attend site.

Benefits of Hello Now
•	Reduction of motor damage cost through direct communication, early intervention, mitigation and restoration 
•	Reduction in traditional assessment report cost. Traditionally an assessor would attend site, view damage and adjust repair quotes. This can now all be done before an assessor turns up to site.
•	Improved policyholder experience and increased confidence in the Insurers brand due to its fast and immediate response
•	Significant reduction in cycle times due to the elimination of stop/start repair process, with all information being gathered accurately up front
•	Higher accuracy of initial claims reserve calculation due to all loss and damage information being captured in the first 24 hours
•	Significant decrease in claims handling costs due to fast cycle times and a reduction in open claims
•	 Reduction or elimination of the traditional field assessment required in simple low value claims.

Requirements and Recommendations
•	Hello Now consume battery power. For best results ensure you have adequate battery remaining and have unnecessary apps closed out on the mobile device.
•	Hello Now consumes streaming data bandwidth. Please check with your service provider for any potential data charges the video transmission will incur, or utilise a Wi-Fi connection or hotspot
•	Please be aware of your environment to protect yourself from accidental streaming of legally protected or private property
•	If any unexpected issues are encountered, we encourage you to provide feedback or contact support so we can improve our services.",,
