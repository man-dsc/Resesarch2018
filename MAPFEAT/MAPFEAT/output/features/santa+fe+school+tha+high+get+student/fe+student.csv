Surfboard - Field Experience,"The Surfboard - Field Experience Edition makes it easy for Students to provide their Teachers with everything they need to complete their Field Experience requirements to receive their Degree.

Teachers can easily create a class for tracking and print an easy to use QR Code for linking to Students.

Students can complete the link by entering their information and scanning their Teachers' QR Code.

Teachers set the Field Experience location for the Students and the Students have an opportunity to accept or decline the event reporting at that location.

That's it! When the Students visit their Field Experience location, the Students State required Field Experience Report is automatically updated.

Teachers can check in on progress to help their Students stay on track!","[['complete'], ['decline', 'accept'], ['progress', 'help'], ['Students'], ['easy'], ['class']]","[['need', 'everything', 'link', 'entering'], ['opportunity', 'event', 'event', 'reporting', 'location'], ['Students', 'check'], ['opportunity', 'linking'], ['print', 'Students', 'use', 'makes'], ['print', 'easily', 'create', 'tracking']]"
