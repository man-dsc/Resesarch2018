iForJesus,"Using iForJesus you will be able to track your personal habits and be empowered to change them.”We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. Aristotle”. iForJesus will help you track the good acts and bad acts you do. iForJesus will help you improve yourself and consider what Jesus would do.  iForJesus is flexible in enabling you to choose the good and bad acts you want to track. You can define the acts from scratch or start with a preconfigured list of acts and customize it according to what you want to achieve. You track your acts daily. For every act you define a value or number of points you associate with that act. The higher the value of an act,  the higher the number of points. For example, smiling to everyone you might value as 100 points while rescuing someone from drawing as 10,000 points.  You should strive to do more good acts than bad acts every day.","[['habits'], ['list', 'preconfigured'], ['track', 'acts'], ['help'], ['points'], ['value'], ['value', 'define'], ['act']]","[['personal', 'track', 'empowered', 'change'], ['start', 'acts', 'acts', 'scratch', 'start'], ['good', 'want'], ['track', 'good', 'acts', 'iForJesus'], ['someone', 'number', 'rescuing', 'higher'], ['The', 'points', 'number', 'higher'], ['number', 'act'], ['points', 'higher', 'number', 'associate']]"
