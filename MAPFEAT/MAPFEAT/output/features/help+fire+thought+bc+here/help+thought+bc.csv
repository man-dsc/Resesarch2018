iForJesus,"Using iForJesus you will be able to track your personal habits and be empowered to change them.”We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. Aristotle”. iForJesus will help you track the good acts and bad acts you do. iForJesus will help you improve yourself and consider what Jesus would do.  iForJesus is flexible in enabling you to choose the good and bad acts you want to track. You can define the acts from scratch or start with a preconfigured list of acts and customize it according to what you want to achieve. You track your acts daily. For every act you define a value or number of points you associate with that act. The higher the value of an act,  the higher the number of points. For example, smiling to everyone you might value as 100 points while rescuing someone from drawing as 10,000 points.  You should strive to do more good acts than bad acts every day.","[['habits'], ['list', 'preconfigured'], ['track', 'acts'], ['help'], ['points'], ['value'], ['value', 'define'], ['act']]","[['personal', 'track', 'empowered', 'change'], ['start', 'acts', 'acts', 'scratch', 'start'], ['good', 'want'], ['track', 'good', 'acts', 'iForJesus'], ['someone', 'number', 'rescuing', 'higher'], ['The', 'points', 'number', 'higher'], ['number', 'act'], ['points', 'higher', 'number', 'associate']]"

As You Think (with Audio),"In 1904, a relatively unknown Englishman named James Allen wrote a little book called As a Man Thinketh. The book has become one of the world’s greatest self-help books — “self-empowerment” is a better term — for it not only reveals to us that the keys to success are within our own minds, it shows us how to use these keys to unlock the greatest fulfillment we can imagine.

In this mobile app edition, author and publisher Marc Allen updates this classic, changing language that has become dated or obsolete, and honing the clarity of the message. He makes As You Think gender inclusive, showing how these principles are truly universal and apply to everyone, regardless of sex, age, race, beliefs, social class, or education.

"Twos - Private space to write, remember, and share","Welcome to Twos - Private space to write, remember, and share.

Twos is a private space for you to record anything.

Twos gives you a free, convenient, and organized space to jot down notes, thoughts, ideas, experiences, etc., to help you remember what you've done, learned, and want to do. Use it to clear your mind, reflect on your day, or write something down you want to remember to do.

Later on, you can search your notes to remember something important, look back on your notes to relive a memory, share a note with friends and family, or pass down notes to your kids to learn from and have a better idea of who you were.

No longer do you need to carry around a notebook to keep notes and remember things. Twos makes it easy to keep everything in one place, to search, look back on, share, and pass down.

We hope you find our tool to be extremely useful and exactly what you need to stop forgetting and start remembering. 

Please reach out to us with any questions, concerns, feedback, or ideas.

Thank you,
