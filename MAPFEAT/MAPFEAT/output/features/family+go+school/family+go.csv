KleptoDogs,"From the makers of KleptoCats and for the livelihood of dog lovers everywhere, it's... KLEPTODOGS!!!

That’s right! GemDog returns home from his adventures with the KleptoCats in order to lead other outrageously cute pups in their quest to fill rooms with the strangest of things.

Unlock all the different breeds: pug, corgi, beagle, chihuahua, some sort of weird alien dog that shouldn't be that shade of radioactive green, etc. The list goes on...

Feed them, play with them and even dress them in the cutest clothes. You’ll have a blast hanging out with these puppy pals!!!","[[], ['quest', 'fill'], ['corgi', 'pug'], ['sort'], []]","[['lovers', 'things', 'dog', 'livelihood', 'strangest', 'rooms'], ['pups', 'rooms', 'dress', 'cutest', 'clothes'], ['beagle', 'breeds'], ['alien', 'beagle', 'weird', 'chihuahua'], ['pals', 'adventures', 'returns', 'hanging', 'home', 'puppy']]"

·      Check to make sure new and young drivers are driving safely

Download the free version of ADT Go and be one of the first to experience the app and mobile emergency response service. Because this is a trial version of ADT Go, we’re still refining the user experience, so you may encounter occasional feature or service delivery issues when you use it. However, we anticipate providing you with frequent updates, which should address the issues.","[['experience'], ['call'], ['go', 'busy'], ['safety'], ['school', 'work'], ['home', 'school'], ['home'], ['updates'], ['delivery', 'service'], ['family', 'contacts'], ['automatic', 'get'], ['detection', 'assistance'], []]","[['one', 'user', 'refining', 'first'], ['feeling', 'unsafe', 'help', 'immediate'], ['safety', 'day'], ['button', 'provides', 'enhanced', 'one-touch'], ['go', 'goes'], ['finish', 'real-time'], ['drive', 'finish', 'alerts', 'real-time'], ['providing', 'issues', 'frequent', 'address'], ['feature', 'issues', 'emergency', 'response', 'service'], ['notify', 'emergency', 'see', 'family', 'members'], ['notifications', 'crash'], ['crash', 'emergency', 'assistance', 'emergency', 'responders'], ['enjoy', 'everyone', 'extra', 'level', 'stay', 'lets']]"
