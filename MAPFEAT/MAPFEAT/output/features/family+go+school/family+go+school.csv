Late to go to school 2,"Oops, it's late for school again!
Wake up in the morning, found that school is late, you rushed to school, saw the teacher standing in the door, you have to find ways to avoid the teacher into school, come on!

Climb in from the dog hole? Turned in from the wall? Or go directly to open the door.
All you have to do is try your best to get into school and avoid being discovered by your teacher.","[['door'], ['school', 'rushed'], ['school'], ['avoid', 'teacher']]","[['standing', 'ways', 'find', 'teacher', 'hole', 'Turned', 'wall'], ['late', 'saw'], ['saw', 'teacher', 'best', 'get'], ['ways', 'school', 'get', 'school', 'avoid']]"
