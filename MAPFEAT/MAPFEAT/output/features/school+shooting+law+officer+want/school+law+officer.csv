"ASSET: Arrest, Search, and Seizure Electronic Tool","Spring 2013 Update. ASSET’s February 2013 update includes dramatically expanded treatment of search and arrest authority pertaining to probationers and other supervisees as well as more citations to landmark cases throughout. Furthermore, ASSET is now optimized for the iPhone 5 and the latest version of iOS! Many thanks to the North Carolina Department of Public Safety and the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association for supporting the update and keeping ASSET free.

Overview. ASSET (Arrest, Search, and Seizure Electronic Tool) gives North Carolina law enforcement officers, and other criminal justice professionals, fast access to the law of investigation. This app contains vital information about the legal issues officers confront every day, from search warrants to Terry stops to GPS tracking. 
 
The legal information contained in ASSET is the work of UNC School of Government faculty member Jeff Welty, a recognized expert in the law of search and seizure who regularly trains judges, lawyers, and officers in the subject.
 
Features:

•Navigation: Users can navigate ASSET using an intuitive table of contents as well as a search function. 

•Bookmarks: ASSET keeps track of recently researched topics and allows the user to bookmark frequently used information. 

•Offline Viewing: Once the app is downloaded to a device, virtually all of the content is available for offline viewing. The app can be used in remote areas or inside secure facilities where cellular networks or WiFi may not be available. 

•Updates: ASSET will be updated periodically as the law changes. The app was last updated on February 15, 2013.

Best of all, ASSET is free. It isn’t a “free trial” or a “free version” with minimal functionality that encourages the user to purchase a paid version – it is completely free of charge, thanks to the generous support of the School of Government Foundation, the North Carolina Department of Public Safety, and the North Carolina Sheriff’s Association.

Users should be aware that ASSET is a quick reference for frequently used information. It is not intended as a substitute for a comprehensive legal reference, such as Robert L. Farb’s book Arrest, Search, and Investigation in North Carolina. Nor is it intended to provide legal advice or to substitute the advice of a law enforcement agency's attorney.

Additional Information. The School of Government offers a wide range of other criminal law resources, many of which are also free of charge. For more information about these resources, please visit the School’s home page, the School’s criminal law page, the School’s publications page, and the North Carolina Criminal Law Blog.

Yakima Police Department,"Welcome to the iPhone/iPad app for the Yakima Police Department. The Yakima Police Department app allows users to report issues or concerns directly from your iPhone or iPad, with photos! There are useful links for community resources, crime prevention, and on-line reporting!

We have also included a personal property catalog that will enable users to take photos and record serial numbers of their valuables.  In the event your property is lost or stolen, the user will be able to share the information with police so the exact item, description and identifying characteristics can aid in getting your property returned.

In addition, users can view the Yakima Police Department’s most wanted and missing persons lists, find Department contact information, explore the Yakima Police Department social media, press release feeds, and get answers to FAQs! 

We hope you find this app useful in keeping Yakima a safe place to live, work and visit!","[['police'], ['press', 'release'], ['resources', 'crime'], ['report', 'issues'], ['allows', 'users'], ['iPad', 'iPhone'], ['record', 'serial'], [], ['persons', 'missing']]","[['exact', 'item', 'share', 'information'], ['media', 'feeds', 'feeds', 'get', 'answers'], ['prevention', 'community', 'links', 'community', 'resources'], ['concerns', 'users'], ['report', 'app'], ['photos', 'app'], ['photos', 'numbers', 'take', 'photos', 'record'], ['description', 'identifying', 'characteristics', 'work', 'live', 'place'], ['wanted', 'lists', 'included', 'personal', 'property']]"
