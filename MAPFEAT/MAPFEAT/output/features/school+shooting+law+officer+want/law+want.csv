Get the Life You Want! Cosmic Ordering by Hypnosis,"GET THE LIFE YOU WANT! COSMIC ORDERING BY HYPNOSIS

Ordering from the Universe, The Secret, The Law of Attraction, Cosmic Ordering – they all have one thing in common – positively focussing your thoughts and feelings. Positive thoughts attract positive things, negative thoughts attract negative experiences. However, things are not that simple. Just because you imagine your dream car, it won’t appear in front of your house. What happens is that when you focus your thoughts and feelings on the things you really want, you start to change your belief systems, your attitude and your behaviour. In this way you gain a better overview of the opportunities and possibilities surrounding you. In this way you will get closer and closer to fulfilling your wish. That’s the magic of the method.

Sometimes we get caught up in thinking about things which we don’t want and can’t manage to focus our energies the way we should. These could be subconscious fears, negative feelings or unclear perceptions, preventing us from doing this. „Get the Life You Want!” can help you to bring your wishes into line with your thoughts and feelings. Subconscious, bothersome belief systems are dismantled and your focus aimed at the things you really want – the first step towards making your wishes come true!

HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS

„Get the Life You Want!” is aimed at people who are open for the principle of attraction and who want to learn how to manifest their wishes faster and with greater success. In a profoundly relaxed state, Kim Fleckenstein dismantles any obstructive belief systems and helps you to (re)”calibrate” your thoughts and feelings towards the things you really want.
