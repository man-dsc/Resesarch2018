Tickle School Edition,"Download the free, new version of Tickle app that adds lots more robots including LEGO: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1063639403

""Fantastic. Program multiple robots, drones, and smart-toys, using a familiar interface."" – Code.org
Tickle is ""the most awesome blocks programming environment for iPad"". Program drones to flip in mid-air, robots to move through mazes, and Star Wars BB-8 Droid to guard the galaxy! You can even program Arduino wirelessly and build custom robots.

+ “There are a lot of games and puzzles now that promise to teach kids how to code, but Tickle stands out.” – TechCrunch

+ ""'School is SO fun.' Thanks @tickleapp for teaching us to fly!"" – Hillcrest Elementary

+ ""Unquestionably the best experience for programming Sphero. Lots of fun."" – @ECiardelli, Math and Learning Resource Teacher. 

+ ""The most awesome blocks programming environment for iPad."" – @moenig, Lead Developer of Snap! (UC Berkeley's Computer Science course CS10).

+ ""Seriously loving the amazing new @tickleapp for iPad. Drag and drop programming for real-world objects like @Sphero"" – Adam Bellow, Author and Educational Technologist.

Tickle is the world's first app that enables anyone to program an air drone. It's also the world's first visual programming app for the Star Wars BB-8 Droid, Sphero (SPRK) robotic ball, Ollie 2-wheeled robot, Parrot Rolling Spider, Airborne, and Jumping Sumo mini drones, Arduino LightBlue Bean, Philips Hue smart home lighting system, and Dash and Dot by Wonder Workshop – all wirelessly from your iPad. You can also program interactive stories and games using our library of animated characters and sounds.

All the devices, Arduino, and virtual characters work seamlessly with each other. For example, you can use Sphero like a Wii controller to fly a drone. Makers, makerspaces, and makerfaires around the world are empowered by Tickle to interactively and wirelessly program Arduino.

Tickle is easy to learn, yet incredibly powerful. Learn to code the same way as the introductory Computer Science courses at Harvard and UC Berkeley. If you've used Sphero MacroLab, orbBasic, Scratch, Pyonkee, Hopscotch, Tynker, Blockly, and Hour of Code, you'll fall in LOVE with Tickle!

Tickle Robotics Edition is inspired by visual programming languages like Scratch from MIT, Alice from CMU, Blockly from Google, and ScratchJr from Tufts/MIT. It is generously supported by awesome Kickstarter backers.","[['home', 'lighting'], ['Makers', 'makerspaces'], ['fly', 'drone'], ['mid-air', 'flip'], ['robots', 'drones'], ['environment', 'programming'], ['visual', 'programming'], ['real-world', 'programming'], ['stories', 'interactive'], ['anyone', 'enables'], ['using', 'familiar'], ['teach', 'promise']]","[['system', 'smart', 'sounds', 'All', 'devices'], ['makerfaires', 'drone'], ['controller', 'Makers'], ['robots', 'drones'], ['multiple', 'smart-toys'], ['iPad', 'blocks', 'The', 'awesome', 'blocks'], ['languages', 'inspired'], ['drop', 'objects'], ['program', 'games'], ['app', 'program', 'anyone', 'program', 'air'], ['interface', 'smart-toys', 'games', 'using', 'library'], ['puzzles', 'kids', 'teach', 'kids', 'code']]"

Oasis Primary School,"The Trail aims to deepen students’ understanding of different culture in Singapore. At the end of the trail, the students should be able to:
1.    State one festival celebrated in each culture.
2.    Describe at least one distinctive feature of each culture. 
 
Scenario in the description:
Imagine your cousin who grew up in Australia will be visiting your family in Singapore for the first time. You are tasked to take your cousin on a journey in understanding the different cultures. To prepare you for the task, you are to find more through the trail. You will embark on the trail and visit the different checkpoints of the shop house.","[['journey'], ['culture'], ['visit'], ['students']]","[['cousin', 'different', 'take', 'understanding'], ['festival', 'different', 'celebrated', 'understanding', 'understanding', 'different', 'cultures'], ['trail', 'different', 'embark', 'checkpoints', 'checkpoints', 'shop', 'house'], ['trail', 'end', 'aims', 'deepen', 'task', 'find', 'trail']]"
