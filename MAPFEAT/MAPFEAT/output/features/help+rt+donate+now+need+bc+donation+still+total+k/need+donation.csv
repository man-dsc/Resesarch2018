The Deed App,"The Deed App aims to increase the ease of giving to the homeless in our communities. The driving idea behind this project is that the homeless are often forgotten and we are trying to lower the barrier of entry for people to connect with and help them.

Here is a brief overview of how our app works: 

-  Homeless participants, or “Deeders” as we have taken to calling them, choose a unique name that identifies them within the app. 
- After creating a simple profile, app users are able to search for these Deeders through an auto-populating search field. 
- The search leads to a profile created for each Deeder (potentially including a picture and self-created story) where users can set a donation amount and easily donate through Paypal via which open in Safari browser.
- When the user touches the donate button they will be redirected to a Safari webpage to complete the transaction.
- At the end of each week, we distribute the donations to the Deeders in the form of food/retail gift cards.
- Additionally, users can track their donations, which would qualify as charitable deductions (501(c)3 Status Pending).
- Users also see other users donations to a Deeder.","[['giving', 'homeless'], ['story', 'self-created'], ['donation', 'set'], ['profile'], ['donations', 'users'], ['trying'], ['people'], [], [], ['retail', 'gift']]","[['communities', 'ease'], ['picture', 'users', 'potentially', 'including', 'picture'], ['amount', 'users'], ['simple', 'app', 'users', 'creating'], ['track', 'see', 'also', 'see', 'users'], ['lower', 'often', 'barrier', 'forgotten'], ['entry', 'help', 'barrier', 'connect'], ['transaction', 'complete', 'webpage', 'overview', 'brief', 'Here'], ['touches', 'unique', 'name', 'button', 'identifies', 'donate'], ['food', 'cards', 'qualify', 'charitable', 'deductions']]"
Connect Global,"CONNECT is a CSR project. It has a global presence via mobile devices or the internet. Our website fills the gap, connecting CSR providers to CSR seekers. CONNECT can adapt to the CSR providers’ budgets, time preferences, geographical location and who they want to donate to. CSR seekers can now get what they actually need, and providers can fill that need. CONNECT simplifies the otherwise lengthy process to just 3 steps.
CONNECT abolishes the time wasted to find a suitable seeker, because it automatically matches the donation to the receiver. While helping thousands of people around the world, we also promote compassion, environmental protection and awareness. CONNECT goes past borders, using one global village: the world.
Our website connects children, people and communities in need of supplies and help to those who are kind and share resources.
