Lick of the Day,"The richest guitar learning experience for iPad and iPhone. 50+ courses spanning 1,200+ lessons.

Great Features: Backing Tracks, Full Screen Tab, Retina display support.
Try Before You Buy: Every Lick Pack includes free Licks to try out! 

Agile has teamed up with TrueFire and JamPlay to bring you Lick of the Day, the guitar learning app! Lick of the Day offers 50+ courses spanning 1,200+ blues, rock, jazz, country, bluegrass, fingerstyle, rockabilly, R&B and acoustic lessons.

Each Lick Pack features 12 to 25 lick video lessons—about 60-90 minutes of video—from a skilled instructor, along with matching interactive tab/notation, text narrative and backing tracks. Many Lick Packs are presented in sets of two volumes per genre, where the second volume builds on the concepts and techniques that were presented in the first. Additional TrueFire and JamPlay Lick Packs are already in the pipeline for release in coming months.

Lick of the Day supports dual instructional modes to optimize the learning experience. In instructor mode, the student follows along with the instructor via video, with synced† tab or music notation and a fretboard display showing the notes being played by the instructor. In practice mode, the student controls the tempo of interactive tablature playback and also has access to the backing track audio to practice what was shown in the video. 

Lick of the Day is powered by the live tablature rendering engine from TabToolkit, winner of the Apple Design Award. Rather than displaying static tablature, Lick of the Day renders tablature dynamically, including realistic guitar audio and advanced features such as A/B looping and speed control. 

Lick of the Day is a free download on the iTunes App Store, and free Licks are available for each Lick Pack to enable guitar students to try out course content before they buy.
