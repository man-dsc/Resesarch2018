Trace Adkins,"The Official iPhone App of TRACE ADKINS. Adkins continues to conquer new worlds. He has long been country music’s alpha male, a man whose commanding presence and once-in-a-generation baritone have made him a pillar of the contemporary Nashville sound. But such are his other gifts—a restless intellect, wide-ranging interests, great ability as a communicator — that it was perhaps inevitable that his influence would spread well beyond the bounds of the genre.

In the past decade, Trace has made his mark as an actor, both on television and in the movies, an author, a voiceover artist and commercial spokesman, a social commentator, and a reality show participant. His effect on businessman and showman Donald Trump was such that after his initial and highly successful appearance on Celebrity Apprentice, he was invited back as a boardroom advisor. He has turned his entertainingly articulated views into a well-received book, A Personal Stand: Observations and Opinions from a Freethinking Roughneck, and has even inspired an action comic book series, Luke McBain, that has proven to be one of the genre’s hottest sellers.","[['baritone'], ['commentator'], ['actor', 'mark'], ['action'], [], []]","[['once-in-a-generation', 'made', 'pillar', 'presence'], ['spokesman', 'social', 'reality', 'show'], ['television', 'made', 'actor', 'television', 'movies'], ['even', 'inspired', 'book', 'comic', 'views', 'well-received', 'book'], ['voiceover', 'artist', 'commercial', 'effect', 'showman', 'businessman'], ['interests', 'worlds', 'great', 'ability', 'conquer', 'new']]"
National Debt - The Debt of 180+ Countries!,"""National Debt"" provides insight into the national debts of more than 180 countries! It shows the development of the national debt in real-time, and provides an overview of the year-to-year historical development of the debt. The app has the option to display the debt as percentage of the gross national product, and show this result on a comprehensive World Debt Map!

To put the large numbers of the national debt into perspective, the app shows what you would have been able to buy with the national debt (e.g. find out how many Iraq Wars is equivalent to the national debt). You can adapt and specify your own items in this list.

The app also shows how long it would take to pay off the debt when paying a given amount per day, and shows the debt as percentage of the gross national product.

The data is based on official numbers provided by the governments and are updated on a regular basis.
