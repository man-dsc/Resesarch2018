Our proven techniques are developed by leading scientists and experts who've been studying evidence-based interventions in the fields of positive psychology, mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy for decades.

HAPPINESS ISN’T JUST ONE THING. IT’S EVERYTHING.

Struggling with everyday challenges and being gripped by negativity is toxic to your emotional and physical wellbeing, your relationships, your performance at work. So when you start to turn the corner, and begin to learn the new habits of successful engagement with life, everything starts to look brighter and better.

SKEPTICAL JOURNALISTS TRIED IT FOR THEMSELVES, AND HERE’S WHAT THEY SAID:

ABC World News' Mara Schiavocampo
""I gave it a shot for 5 weeks...it works!""

The New York Times
""Each track contains bite-size quizzes, games and activities that guide you to seeing more positive aspects of daily life.""

The TODAY Show
""These are things you can do every day -- tasks you can complete and be rewarded for -- to feel better, reduce stress, live a better life, and actually be happy.""

THOUSANDS THANK US. HERE ARE SOME MOVING EXAMPLES:

“I have felt less stressed, more positive, more motivated, more appreciative of the many things I have to be grateful for, and more present. I have even been quarreling less with my husband and sleeping more soundly!” - Sarah S., Boston, MA

""When I first started, I was skeptical about some of the exercises. However, I was willing to try them...and my skepticism faded when I realized they helped. I have less bad days...and when I have bad days, they disperse more quickly, and they're not as severe as they were before Happify."" - Jessica G., West Park, FL

""I realized that I may not be able to control certain aspects of my life, but I can control how I respond. Today, I am more relaxed. My stress levels are lower, and while I may still get upset, my reactions are not as intense. I am better able to catch myself in the cycle of negative thinking and rumination, and then I lower it immediately."" - J. Ward, Chapel Hill, NC

EWG's Food Scores,"How does your food score? How do we know what we’re eating, really? Food processors make so many claims these days. Supermarkets are loaded with foods that contain chemicals no one can pronounce.

The database includes more than:
•    80,000 products
•    5,000 ingredients
•    1,500 brands
 
How did we come up with our scores? We combine these ratings into a single overall product score. 

-- Nutrition. The nutrition scoring algorithm considers multiple factors, including calories, saturated fat, trans fat, sugar, sodium, protein, fiber and fruit, vegetable and nut content.
 
-- Ingredient concerns. The ingredient concerns algorithm focuses on factors such as the likely presence of key contaminants, pesticides, hormones and antibiotics and the health implications of certain food additives.
 
-- Processing. The processing score reflects EWG's best estimate of the extent to which a particular food has been processed.
