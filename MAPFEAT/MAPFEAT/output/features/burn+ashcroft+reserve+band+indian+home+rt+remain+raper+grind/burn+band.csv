JoiiSports – Guide you to workout with heart rate,"JoiiSports is a health promotion tool which provides heart rate monitoring by heart rate device and workout historical summary data that allows you to exercise more efficiently and safely.

JoiiSports also offers the ""Team Buidling in Cloud"" and the ""Personal Achievement Challenge"" function, which encourages people to do workout by the power of the social community.

What is effective exercise?

Effective exercise can be indicated from heart rate. General speaking, the maximum heart rate of each person is “220 – age” (unit: beats / minute). Effective exercise defined by JoiiSports is that the heart rate during exercise is greater than 55% of the maximum heart rate.

For example, a 28-year-old office worker has a maximal heart rate of 192 bpm (220-28). To achieve effective exercise, the heart rate must reach 106 bpm. (192x0.55) The heart rate is over the maximal heart rate when doing exercise will affect your health due to overloading of heart.

People often can not distinguish between workout and body wastage because of no any indication. Heart rate is the key to effective safe exercise.

Resistance Band Exercises – Training Exercise and Full Body Workout to Get Strong Muscles,"Get results and attractive body quickly. While other exercise plans call for up to two hours of your day, this high-intensity workout app only ask for 7 minutes to melt the extra weight right off.

High-intensity interval and intermittent training is the workout of the future. Research has shown that short bursts of exercise are more effective in weight loss than other aerobic activities. In addition, these anaerobic exercises improve your glucose metabolism (for better digestion) and increase athletic condition (for both your health and looking better). Essentially, by pushing yourself for short periods of times, instead of pacing over several hours, your body prepares itself for more intense exercise and gets you in shape faster.
