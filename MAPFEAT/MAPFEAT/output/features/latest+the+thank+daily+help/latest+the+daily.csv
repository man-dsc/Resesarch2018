Read Our Story: The Future is Bright

When it was first published in 1952, The Daily Star became the Arab world’s first newspaper in English. Serving Lebanon and the Middle East with unrivaled local journalism in a foreign language, the paper offered the world a local view and domestic expertise on a rapidly changing region that very rarely failed to feature on top of the news agenda.

Despite interruptions during Lebanon’s Civil War, the newspaper returned to newsstands in the mid-1990s to reclaim its spot as the main source of Lebanon news in English.

The technological revolution that erupted at the turn of the century changed the ways people are consuming information and following the news. First the Internet then social media presented challenges for newspapers worldwide.

The Daily Star today is not only a newspaper. It has risen to the challenge and now offers its unique coverage of Lebanon and the region whenever and wherever you, the reader, want it.

But this costs money and financial realities mean that we have to increase our revenue to be able to continue to provide you with the best, unbiased coverage of Lebanon.

Therefore from July 10, 2015,  we will be offering our worldwide readers complete access to our digital content for a monthly fee.

This gives our subscribers:

    - Unlimited website access
    - Mobile news on in app on all iOS devices
    - Daily newsletters by email
    - Full archive access

Readers who don’t wish to subscribe will be able to continue reading our wires-based content for free but will miss out on original news, business, lifestyle, opinion, sports, and arts and culture coverage from Lebanon and the region.

Our readers in Lebanon will continue to access all our news for free but only for a very limited period of time.

We are thankful that we have such a loyal and trusting readership base. We appreciate your contribution towards helping us maintain our high standards and in return we renew our commitment to you to redouble our efforts and continue to produce the best news content out of Lebanon now and in the future.","[['portion'], ['user'], ['devices'], ['suggestions'], ['renew', 'return'], [], ['cost', 'identify'], ['active', 'subscription', 'allowed'], ['current'], ['revolution'], ['century'], ['increase', 'mean'], ['feature'], ['information'], ['news', 'breaking'], ['customize', 'news'], ['website', 'Unlimited'], ['readers'], ['continue', 'able'], ['continue'], ['hard-hitting', 'investigative'], ['local'], ['offers'], ['politics', 'coverage'], ['culture', 'arts'], ['opinion', 'lifestyle'], ['opinion', 'outspoken'], [], [], [], ['feedback', 'welcomes'], ['challenges', 'presented'], ['newsstands']]","[['unused', 'trial', 'Any', 'free'], ['purchases', 'forfeited', 'managed', 'auto-renewal'], ['app', 'newsletters', 'iOS', 'Daily'], ['application', 'regarding', 'thoughts', 'hearing', 'forward', 'hearing', 'thoughts'], ['commitment', 'standards', 'maintain', 'high', 'standards'], ['account', 'renewal', 'Account', 'remain', 'active', 'charged', 'Payment', 'charged', 'iTunes'], ['period', 'renewal'], [], ['cancellation', 'end', 'period', 'subscription'], ['turn', 'The', 'erupted', 'technological'], ['ways', 'turn', 'changed', 'erupted', 'changed', 'ways', 'people'], ['realities', 'revenue', 'money', 'financial', 'realities'], ['failed', 'top', 'rarely', 'news'], ['following', 'news', 'consuming', 'people'], ['entitles', 'latest'], ['entitles', 'suit'], ['access', 'subscribers'], ['worldwide', 'access', 'complete', 'offering', 'access', 'digital', 'content'], ['subscribe', 'revenue'], ['access', 'provide', 'best', 'news', 'continue', 'reading', 'wires-based'], ['journalism', 'reports', 'journalism', 'foreign', 'language'], ['world', 'journalism', 'unrivaled', 'view', 'view', 'domestic', 'expertise'], ['challenge', 'unique', 'coverage', 'risen'], ['news', 'business', 'politics', 'business', 'sports'], ['coverage', 'sports', 'opinion', 'sports', 'arts'], ['business', 'sports'], ['articles', 'journalism', 'opinion', 'articles', 'editorials'], ['rapidly', 'region', 'fast', 'online', 'changing', 'offline'], ['end', 'billing', 'spot', 'source', 'main', 'cycle'], ['A', 'readership', 'trusting', 'base', 'interface', 'user-friendly'], ['look', 'team', 'appreciate', 'contribution', 'towards'], ['media', 'newspapers'], ['newspaper', 'mid-1990s', 'returned', 'reclaim']]"
