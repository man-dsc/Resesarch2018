PreeMi,"PreeMi keeps you safe and alert! It monitors all your frequently visited locations for suspicious activities such as mass shootings, robberies, abductions, accidents and much more.

Multiple Locations - We all tend to visit more than one locations. For example, you go to work, school, your favorite restaurant, parents house, kids school, etc. By adding the addresses of these places to PreeMi, they will be monitored for suspicious events. Should there be an incident at one of these locations, PreeMi will send you an alert so you can take the necessary action to protect yourself and love ones. Hey, you can't be at multiple places at once, but PreeMi sure can!

Invitations - By inviting your contacts, friends, and family members to use the PreeMi app, they can also inform you of suspicious activities at your monitored locations. PreeMi will also help to keep them safe as well. So as you can see, it's a win-win for everyone!

Report It - As you see something suspicious, use PreeMi to report it so that people in the area can take the necessary steps to protect themselves. We are in this together, so play your part.


Note: PreeMi is NOT an alternative to the 911 service. If there is a life-threatening emergency, please call 911 immediately! Once it is safe, you may use the PreeMi app to report the incident so that others can be aware of it. 

- Alerts will be sent via text messaging.
- Your carrier may charge a fee to receive SMS.","[[], [], [], ['friends', 'family'], ['report'], ['school'], ['favorite', 'restaurant'], ['house', 'kids'], ['protect', 'love'], ['shootings', 'mass'], ['robberies', 'abductions'], ['activities', 'locations'], ['suspicious']]","[['adding', 'necessary', 'addresses', 'places', 'steps', 'take'], ['multiple', 'places', 'work', ""n't"", 'go', 'example'], ['play', 'help', 'together', 'keep', 'also', 'part'], ['members', 'contacts', 'inviting', 'contacts', 'friends'], ['incident', 'area', 'people', 'others'], ['go', 'etc', 'kids', 'work'], ['school', 'parents'], ['school', 'parents', 'restaurant', 'parents', 'house'], ['action', 'ones', 'take', 'necessary', 'action'], ['robberies', 'activities'], ['shootings', 'accidents'], ['suspicious', 'monitored'], ['use', 'monitored', 'something', 'events']]"
