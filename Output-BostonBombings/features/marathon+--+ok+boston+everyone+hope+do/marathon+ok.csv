Half Marathon Trainer - Run/Walk/Run Beginner and Advanced Training Plans with Jeff Galloway,"Complete your first half marathon, or improve your half marathon race time, with legendary Olympian Jeff Galloway. Jeff's unique Run-Walk-Run training method builds speed and endurance for runners of all levels, focusing on injury-free training and, above all, the pure enjoyment of running.

Jeff's unique Run-Walk-Run training method uses the principles of High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) to quickly, and safely improve your endurance. Studies have shown that 27 minutes of HIIT 3 times a week promotes the same cardio improvements as running continuously for 60 minutes, 5 times a week. Why beat up your body with inefficient training when you can get fit fast with the Galloway Method.

• Includes periodic Magic Mile Tests to measure your progress and dial in your pace.
• The time goal program includes Cadence Drills, Acceleration Gliders, and Speed Interval Training sessions to improve your form as you condition your body.
• Half point indicator to let you know when to turn around.
• Includes GPS tracking. 
• Works outside or an a treadmill. 
• Completely interactive. Change your workout at anytime and your coach Jeff Galloway — and your music — will respond! 
• Sync your workouts to the Health app.

Bonus Content: Download 15 tracks of high-energy fitness music for FREE.

EXPERT INSTRUCTION
 Jeff Galloway is truly a running legend. He ran with Steve Prefontaine, Bill Rodgers, Frank Shorter, and Amby Burfoot when the United States was a leading power in marathoning. He ran in over 130 marathons and continues to average about 7 marathons a year. Jeff is also a legendary running coach, with over 30 years of expertise safely progressing runners of all levels to the finish line with a smile on their faces. Jeff's running books have sold over a million copies, and he writes a monthly column in Runner's World. If you're looking for an expert coach, why not have one of the best in the world?

  BEAT-SYNC 
Easy Half Marathon dynamically changes the beat of YOUR music to perfectly match your pace. Research shows that music distracts the brain during exercise and faster music causes people to accept and even prefer a greater degree of effort. This means you will work harder without trying (or without even feeling the difference), you will get better results from the increased effort, and most importantly, the time will fly by. You can also download 15 tracks of high-energy fitness music for FREE to really get your playlist pumping.  

DESIGNED AROUND YOU 
Whether you're looking to complete your first race or you want to improve your half marathon time, Easy Half Marathon has the perfect program for you. Your pace and Run-Walk-Run ratio of each workout is customized to your ability, plus Easy Half Marathon gives you complete control as you move through your workout. Turn the intensity down a bit when you're struggling or crank it up when you're ready for more, and Easy Half Marathon adjusts your workout — and your music — on the fly.  

GPS TRACKING
 Easy Half Marathon includes GPS tracking* so you can see your pace and the distance covered during your workouts. GPS works best outside with a clear view of the sky. When you want to work indoors on a track or on a treadmill, use your beat-synced music to set your pace, and Easy Half Marathon will track your results.  

Works with Health
- Completed workouts sync to the Health app, including distance, calories burned and duration.

ABOUT THE TRAINING PLAN - NOVICE 1
This Novice 1 Half Marathon Training Program is designed both for beginner runners who want to prepare for a 13.1-mile race, but also for experienced runners interested in a fail safe program that will help them to excel without making excessive demands on their time.

Before starting to train for a half marathon, you need to possess a basic fitness level. If you are over age 35, you probably should see your doctor for a physical exam, but assuming no major health problems, most healthy people can train themselves to complete a 13.1-mile race.

The training plan assumes you have the ability to run 3 miles, three to four times a week. If that seems difficult, consider a shorter distance for your first race. You can try our best selling Ease into 5K app which will prepare you to run 3 miles three times a week.

Marathon_Calculator,"This tool assits you in identifying your optimal pace for running competitions. Well suited for amateur runners as well as professionals:

The app allows you to calculate your time for running a marathon based on your times for shorter distances - given that you are as well prepared for the marathon as for the shorter distances.

In addition, the app calculates your optimal intermediate times (taking into account the elevation profile). It also provides you a personal analysis on whether your potential is rather on short distances (base speed) or on long distances (stamina).

The app does not only allow to evaluate marathons but any distance race. Thanks to the indiviualized parameters used, the calculations work very well for hobby runners as well as for professional athletes.

The app contains a total of 83 running courses in the United States, Germany and Switzerland. When downloading and evaluating the elevation profile of a running course, a one-time fee is charged (USD 0.99 to USD 2.99, depending on the course).

Alternatively, you have the option to configure and evaluate courses of your choice free of charge.
