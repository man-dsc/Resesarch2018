Boston Marathon Hams,"This application can only be used by amateur radio operators who have been approved to use it. If you were not instructed to use this by your segment coordinator, then you won't be able to log in.

This app allows ham operators on the buses to electronically scan runner bibs. The information gets logged with net control so NCO's can find a missing runner if they are on a bus.

This app was written by volunteers on the marathon amateur radio team. We may expand the functionality if it works well in 2018.  We will be looking for feedback on the app during the after action survey.","[['gets', 'logged'], ['amateur', 'radio'], ['allows', 'ham'], ['use', 'segment']]","[['information', 'net', 'bibs', 'The', 'information'], ['operators', 'used', 'marathon', 'amateur', 'radio'], ['operators', 'app', 'app', 'written', 'volunteers'], ['coordinator', 'instructed', 'find', 'missing', 'runner']]"
