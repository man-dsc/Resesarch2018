THE RECENT MASS SHOOTINGS IN THE #US ALL HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON:      ➖  MISOGYNY➖   Jessica Valenti https://t.co/QvJmCICPKi
"@Fight4yourLives @ViajaMasTerca @davidhogg111 This school isn't far from me and I knew students in that school. None of them were hurt, and it is only one of at least 4 school shootings that were stopped by armed resource officers since the Parkland shooting. The Santa Fe shooting was the only one where people died."

Let’s see how fast the media stops talking about the Annapolis shooting now that they found out that it was not politically motivated and the shooter used a shotgun and not an AR-15.  It doesn’t fit their narrative so they don’t care.   Just like Santa Fe.  Sad but true.

@DilsikesIdiots @liliana425 @SusanLind1 @LDoren @OregonJOBS2 @Ocasio2018 And today's shooting was brought to you by a gun not on the #gunsense hit list so that would seem to disprove your opinion. This shooting and Santa Fe prove the type of gun doesn't matter. The gun is not the problem. The criminal is.
